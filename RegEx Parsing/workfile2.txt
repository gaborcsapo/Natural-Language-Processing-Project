Overhead is the Palau’s crowning glory, a magical stained glass orb. Behind the musicians a curved wall is covered with mosaics of muses playing instruments, from bagpipes to castanets. Their upper bodies are made of porcelain and seem to emerge magically from the walls. If this all sounds like the recipe for nausea, you simply have to see it to believe it. The best way to experience the Palau is to attend a concert. The hall was built in 1908 for a musical society called the Orfeó Català, but today programs range from top symphony orchestras and soloists to avant-garde pop-rock outfits. Tickets may be purchased at the box office on the c/ Sant Pere Més Alt, near the top of via Laietana. Guided tours, in English, Spanish, and Catalan (just be sure you sign up for the right one) are daily from 10am to 3:30pm (Tel. [93/268 10 00]). The recent demolition of the undistinguished church next the Palau is part of a long-awaited expansion plan.

it looks better than ever. The apartments inside had suffered unspeakable horrors, and Gaudí’s beautiful arched attics had been sealed up, but today everything has been restored to its original state. The attic floor is now a handsomely realized, high-tech Gaudí museum (called Espai Gaudí). Opened to the public, in late 1999, was one of the original Gaudí apartments, all odd shapes, handcrafted doorknobs, and idiosyncratic details. It has been meticulously outfitted with period furniture, a great number of the pieces designed by Gaudí. For many, though, the highlight continues to be the wavy rooftop, with its cluster of swirling Darth Vader-like chimneys and spectacular views of Barcelona all the way to the sea. La Pedrera had one of the world’s first underground parking garages; today the space houses an ampitheater where cultural conferences are held. The building’s owner, the cultural foundation Fundació Caixa de Catalunya, has transformed the second floor into a sumptuous exhibition space for a variety of impressively curated shows (entrance is free). Tours of Casa Milà are given in English, Spanish, and Catalan, daily 10am–8pm, and they include access to the Espai Gaudí and rooftop (tel. [93/484 59 95]). On summer weekend evenings between 8pm and midnight you can enjoy a variety of cocktails and jazz music on the terrace.

Montserrat can be reached in spectacular fashion by train from Barcelona’s Plaça d’Espanya. On arrival at the Montserrat station about an hour later, a cable car continues right up the side of the mountain to the monastery. A much-less preferable bus service also operates from Barcelona by Transportes Julià (Tel. [93/490 40 00]). By car, leave Barcelona via the Diagonal and take the highway, direction Tarragona, exiting at Sortida 25.

There are several good restaurants near town, which the staff of Codorniu will point out. The winery is open year-round (except Christmas and New Year’s), and guided visits in English are free during the week. On Sundays, visitors receive a champagne glass along with their tasting, and the visit costs just 200 pta. (US$1.40). Call [93/301 46 00] for more information. By car, which takes approximately 40 minutes, take the A-2 highway in the direction of Tarragona/Lleida; exit 27 is Sant Sadurní d’Noia, and the road Cordoniu is clearly marked. Autocares La Hispano Ilariense buses (Tel. [93/8912 25 61]) make the trip, leaving from the corner of Avda. de Sarrià and Urgell.

For a closer look at all the wide-open spaces, take a train. VIA Rail Canada is the national passenger-train system using the tracks of Canadian Pacific and Canadian National, who devote themselves strictly to more lucrative freight carrying. Serving pretty good food in comfortable diners, with club cars, observation decks, and sleeping cars, VIA takes a leisurely four days from Montréal to Vancouver. (From Montréal to Toronto it’s 51⁄2 hours, faster by train than by road.) You may also want to consider Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (tel. [(800) 665-7245], <www.rockymountaineer.com>), which offers daylight trips through the Canadian Rockies.

No tour of Toronto’s civic past and present is complete without a pilgrimage over to Bond Street, south of Dundas, to Mackenzie House, home of Toronto’s first and most celebrated mayor (82 Bond St., tel. [(416) 392-6915]). William Lyon Mackenzie, a Dundee-born Scot, lived here after his return from exile for leading a revolt in 1837 (see page 20). In the meticulously restored interior, guides in traditional colonial dress explain the memorabilia of the fiery newspaperman, including the hand-operated flatbed printing press on which he turned out his revolutionary newspaper, The Colonial Advocate.

You may like to drive the more roundabout coast road over to Louisbourg with a side trip to Glace Bay. As an intriguing exercise in modern industrial archaeology, its desolate log cabins and colliery installations have become a coal mining village museum. Take the fascinating trip along the shafts and galleries of the abandoned Ocean Deep Mine, which reaches 17 km (11 miles) under the sea. You can have a coal miner’s meal at the colliery canteen. The great French fortress town of Louisbourg is presented as a splendid national historic park, one of the most elaborate in Canada’s ambitious reconstruction program. You’ll need a full day to do it justice. After the guided tour, take time to discuss extra details of 18th-century French colonial life with the well-informed and entertaining costumed volunteers performing the roles of fishermen, merchants, soldiers, and craftspeople (Tel. [(902) 733-2280], <www.fortresslouisbourg.com>).

Leave the Trans-Canada 11/2 km (1 mile) east of Revelstoke town to drive the winding Summit Road up Mount Revelstoke, 2,120 m (6,370 ft), the only mountain in Canada that you can “climb” by car. This is the cozy way to watch the park’s landscape change from dense lowland forest, through alpine meadows dotted with wild flowers, to the bleak tundra of the high country. From the top you look out over the Columbia and Illecillewaet river valleys and back to the Monashee Mountains. There are no campgrounds inside the park, but if you’re planning to tent overnight along the 65 km (39 miles) of clearly marked hiking-trails, check in with the park administration office in downtown Revelstoke (P.O. Box 350, Revelstoke, B.C. VOE250; tel. 250-[837-7500]). This is the place to get your detailed maps and fishing permit. In the creeks and lakes, you’ll find an abundance of trout — rainbow, brook, brown, cut-throat, and red-spotted Dolly Varden — as well as whitefish, char, and bass. Nature-lovers may spot elk, moose, and mountain goat, bird-watchers look for grey jay, blue grouse, and golden eagle, while everyone should watch out for black bear.

You can book tickets for performances on your arrival but popular acts or plays may sell out quickly. The VVV issues a What’s on in Amsterdam magazine on a monthly basis which lists the performances taking place each day. The easiest way to book tickets for performances before you arrive in town is through the Amsterdam Uit Bureau (AUB-Uitlijn). They produce a publication called Culture in Amsterdam with a listing of major performances. Contact them at Tel. [621 1211] and have your credit cards ready. Tickets can be posted to your home address or will be kept at the AUB office in Leidseplein for you to collect.

The Holland Festival is a program of art events which take place all over the country throughout June. In Amsterdam the parks and pleins are filled with organized activities, and many galleries and concert halls hold coordinated events. A special ticket line will provide information about the festival activities, and tickets if you pay by credit card (Tel. [627 6566]).

The Amsterdam Casino at Max Euweplein off Leidseplein offers the opportunity for adults to gamble (Tel. [620 1006]). Open every day from 1:30pm.

There are many wooded and park areas around the city where it’s possible to take a simple stroll or enjoy other outdoor activities. Amsterdam Bos (city woodland and recreational area), is the largest and most varied and offers a lake for rowing, bridleways for horse rides, and tracks for cycling — you could hire a bike and spend the day here. Many Amsterdammers go running, frisbeeing, or simply take the dog for a walk. The stables at Amsterdam Bos offer woodland rides, a perfect way to clear the city air from your system (contact Manege de Amsterdamse; Tel. [643 1432]).

With so much water around the city, it’s not surprising that water-based sports are very popular. Even on the canals in the city center you’ll find pedalos (sometimes called water cycles) to rent so that you can see the sights on your own steam. Contact them on Tel. [626 5574]; fax 624 1033. You can also captain your own boat to explore the area. Canal Motorboats BV has two locations in the city; Tel. [422 7070] for information and reservations.

On the wider waterways outside the old part of town you will find rowing clubs and sailing clubs which take to the open water in good weather all year round. Out on the IJsselmeer (the inland waterway what was the Zuider Zee) on any sunny weekend you’ll see hundreds of white sails breaking the horizon. Boats can be hired for trips out on the water from Monnikendam or you can take a trip on a crewed boat, although you’ll need to make a booking well in advance. Contact Monnickendam Zeilcharters at ‘t Prooyen 4a, 1141 VD Monnickendam; Tel. [0299 652351]; fax 0299 653618; e-mail <hzc@sailing.nl>.

Despite spending more time than most people riding bicycles, cycling for fun is one of the major recreational activities of the Dutch. Cycle routes parallel most roadways making longer journeys relatively easy, and sporting groups or families will head out to villages like Monnikendam or Marken. Closer to the city, a ride through Vondelpark gives you a feeling of being out of the city. If you would like to tour with a group either in the city or surrounding countryside, you should contact Yellow Bike Guided Tours, Nieuwezijds Kolk 29; Tel. [620 6940], fax 620 7140. They operate daily tours with English guides between April and October.

Having little to do with wine, but plenty to do with the historic underpinnings of this region, are the archaeological park and sublime Paleolithic rock drawings near Vila Nova de Foz Côa (8 km/5 miles south of Pocinho). Discovered only in 1992, the engravings of deer, goats, and horses constitute the largest outdoor assembly of Paleolithic rock art in Europe. Visits are by guided tour only, through the headquarters of the foundation overseeing the project. Attendance is strictly limited, and slots to visit the three sites are often reserved weeks in advance. Visit the Web site of Parque Arqueológico do Côa <www.ipa.min-cultura.pt/coa> to arrange visits in advance, or stop by the headquarters in Vila Nova de Foz Côa (Av. Gago Coutinho, 19 A; Tel. [351/279 768 260]/1). Visits last a couple of hours (to each site, arranged separately) and transportation to the sites is included. 

The following are two reputable local dive centers: Diving Adventures, Calle 5 Sur #22, Cozumel; Tel. [87/2-3009]; <www.divingadventures.net>. Scuba Cancún, km 5 Paseo Kukulkán, lagoon side, Cancún; Tel. [98/83-1011]; fax 98/84-2336.

Not yet qualified to dive? Both SNUBA and BOB are half-and-half water experiences. With both you are underwater, but with a constant supply of air from tubes at the surface. BOB, the Breathing Observation Bubble, is a kind of underwater scooter with oxygen helmet. Contact Hotel Cancún Marina Club, km 5.5 (Tel. [98/83-4440]), for details. With SNUBA you wear a helmet, but you walk on the ocean floor. Contact AquaWorld in Cancún for further details.

Swim with the dolphins. These programs exist at various locations around the region, so you will have the opportunity no matter which of the big resorts you choose. Some venues have a range of different programs, from simply free-swimming with dolphins, to performing exercises with them, to helping a trainer for a day. Dolphin Discovery operates programs at Isla Mujeres, Cozumel, and Puerto Aventuras; <www.dolphindiscovery.com>. Other programs can be found at Xcaret; Tel. [98/83-3143]; fax 98/83-3324.

Viewing marine life without getting wet. If getting into the water isn’t for you, then take a glass-bottom boat ride; trips navigate the mangrove swamps or venture out to the ocean reefs. It is also possible to travel under the surface of the water in a submersible craft. Nautibus, Sub See Explorer, and Atlantis XII all submerge to 50 m (150 ft) to explore the reef eco-system. Nautibus has four sailings a day: El Embarcadero, km 4 Cancún Hotel Zone; Tel. [98/83-3732]. AquaWorld boasts various craft as well — they can be found at Kukulkán Boulevard, km 15.2 Hotel Zone; Tel. [98/85-2288]; fax 98/85-2299; <www.aquaworld.com.mx>. Atlantis Submarine: Chankanaab km 4, Casa del Mar Hotel, Cozumel; Tel. [987/2-5671] or (888) REAL-SUB (toll-free in the US); <www.goatlantis.com>.

Prices vary, but a full day’s rental of boat and crew (up to six passengers) is between $400–500. Half-day rentals are also available. Ocean Tours in San Miguel is just one boat-charter company; Tel. [987/2-1379]; fax 987/2-3459; e-mail: <ocean@cozumel.czm.com.mx>.

Here are some of the most dependable shops on the Out Islands: In Hope Town, Water’s Edge Studios offers wood carvings by Russ Ervin, and Island Gallery stocks selected handicrafts and souvenirs. Island Made Gift Shop in Gregory Town (Eleuthera; Tel. [335-5369]) has a good supply of Bahamian gifts and crafts. Reliable spots to shop for Abaco Gold are Green Turtle Cay and Marsh Harbour.

The Bahamas Sports and Aviation Information Centre provides complete information about sports facilities in the Bahamas. Call them toll-free at 800-32-SPORT (within the US only) or at [305-932-0051], or write for information to 19495 Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 809, Aventura, Florida 33180, USA.

Wind surfing. With its many shallow lagoons, the Bahamas is a great place for wind surfing. Most large hotels have boards for rent. Para-sailing (soaring overhead in a parachute harness pulled by a speedboat) is also available in New Providence (Cable Beach and Paradise Island) and Grand Bahama (Lucaya), but make sure you’re fully insured before taking to the air — many policies exclude this popular activity. Sea Sports at the Nassau Marriott Resort on Cable Beach has a full compliment of water-sport equipment for rent (Tel. [327-6200]).

Diving and snorkeling. Opportunities for diving and snorkeling in the Bahamas are almost unrivaled in terms of both the quality of the experience and the variety of stunning habitats. The area’s clear waters and numerous coral reefs and rocky outcrops offer an ideal environment for hundreds of species of fish, as well as turtles, dolphins, and, yes, sharks. A number of dive centers offer transport to the sites along with the assistance of experienced and qualified dive masters. The two main centers on Nassau and Grand Bahama are Nassau Scuba Centre (Tel. [362-1964]; fax 362-1198; US Tel. [(954) 462-3400]; US fax (954) [462-4100]; website <http://www.nassau-scuba-centre.com,)> and UNEXSO (Tel. [373-1244]; fax 373-8956; US Tel. [(954) 351-9889]; US fax (954) [351-9740]). Both of these companies also run trips to Andros, Eleuthera, and Exuma. You’ll also find diving and snorkeling opportunities on the main islands of New Providence and Grand Bahama. And there are special places around the Out Islands that offer exceptional experiences, though not much lively entertainment out of the water. Here is a list of particularly exciting sites:

Andros. The barrier reef here is the third longest in the world. At 60 ft (20 m) below the surface, it is for divers only, though snorkelers can splash around in the shallow coastal areas, which are also rich in sea life. Spectacular large fish and sharks are usually sighted here at the “Tongue of the Ocean,” which in some places lies only 120 ft (40 m) offshore but drops an amazing 6000 ft (2000 m) to the ocean trench. There are also several “blue holes” — vivid blue ocean holes, some with mazes of tunnels and caves — to be explored. Small Hope Bay Lodge on Andros offers diving vacations (Tel. [368-2014]; fax 368-2015).

Bimini. At Paradise Point you can explore the formations that are said to be the lost city of Atlantis. Contact Bill and Nowddla Keefe’s Bimini Undersea for information on excursions (Tel. [347-3089]; fax [652-9148]; US Tel. [(305) 653-5572]; US fax (305) [652-9148]).

San Salvador. Because the reef wall here lies only 40 ft (15 m) below the surface, this site is much more accessible for less experienced divers than the Andros reef. It’s said to be a great place to see groups of hammerhead sharks as well as turtles and huge rays. Contact Riding Rock Inn for information on diving (Tel. [331-2631]; fax 331-2020; US Tel. [(954) 359-8353]; US fax (954) [359-8254]).

Long Island. Shark Reef near Stella Maris is the most famous area in the islands for close encounters with that most feared aquatic creature. Here you can watch the “feeding frenzy” of sharks from close quarters. There are also pristine reef walls off Conception Island and Rum Cay. Contact the Stella Maris Resort (Tel. [338-2050]; fax 338-2052; US Tel. [(954) 359-8236]; US fax (954) [359-8238]).

The Abacos. The Cathedral, west of Guana Cay, is a huge cave lit with sunlight streaming through holes in the ceiling; The large entrance makes it relatively safe for novice divers. Walkers Cay’s shark-feeding program allows divers to watch large groups of sharks fight over a frozen fish “chumsickle” (buckets of fish parts frozen into a block that thaws in the warm water, releasing the fish slowly to prolong the feeding). Contact Walkers Cay Undersea Adventures (Tel. [352-1252]; fax 353-1339; US Tel. [(954) 462-3400]; US fax (954) [462-4100]).

As a general rule, the larger and more populous islands have the newer and better boats for rent. Prices vary, but a full day’s charter of a boat and crew averages $400–$500. Half-day rentals are also available. Contact one of the following for additional information: Days Catch Charter, Abaco (Tel. [809/336-0059]); Coopers Charter Service, George Town, Exuma (Tel. [809/336-2711]); or Peace and Plenty Bonefish Lodge, George Town, Exuma (Tel. [345-5555]; fax 345-5556). The Andros Island Bonefishing Lodge is a prime center for bonefishing expeditions (Tel. [368-5167]; fax 368-2026).

For information about sailing rentals contact The Moorings (Tel. [367-4000]; fax 367-4004; website <http://www.moorings. com>). Smaller boats for local jaunts can be rented at Sea Horse Boat Rentals, Marsh Harbour, Abacos (Tel. [367-2513]; fax 367-2516; website <http://www.sea-horse.com>. Nassau Yacht Haven also has sailboats for rent (Tel. [393-8173]).

The Bahamas has a number of PGA-level courses. Grand Bahama has the well tended Lucaya Golf and Country Club (Tel. [373-1066]), and the Bahamas Princess Golf and Country Club, part of the Bahamas Princess Complex at Freeport, has two courses (Tel. [352-6721]) both designed by Dick Wilson. New Providence has Paradise Island Golf Club (Tel. [363-3925]) and one at Cable Beach (Tel. [327-6000]). On Abaco Island, Treasure Beach has an 18-hole course (Tel. [365-8045]).

If you don’t sail yourself, this is a great way to see the Bahamas from the water. Even if you can’t get out to some of the Out Islands, such as the Exumas, you can sail out to one of the cays near Nassau to get a feel for the atmosphere of the more remote parts of the Bahamas. Top Sail Yacht Cruises takes small parties from the British Colonial Beach Dock to places like Rose Island (Tel. [393-0820]). Majestic Tours, at Prince George Dock, has the largest boats (Tel. [322-2606]). On Grand Bahama, Superior Watersports offers daily cruises (Tel. [373-7863]).

The casinos at the Marriott Resort on Cable Beach (Tel. [327-6200]), Atlantis on Paradise Island (Tel. [363-3000]), and the Princess Resort on Grand Bahama (Tel. [352-7811]) all offer roulette, craps, and blackjack as well as slot machines. The slot machines operated 24 hours a day, but there are limited hours for the gaming tables: at Atlantis they’re open 10am–4am, at Princess Casino and the Marriott 9am–3am.

If gambling is not your cup of tea, allow yourself to be dazzled by one of the nightly Las Vegas–style floor shows at the Marriott, Atlantis, or the Princess. For information about the Princess cabaret, call [352-6721]; for the Marriott Palace Revue, call [327-6200], for the Atlantis, call [363-3000].

Performing Arts. In the principal cities, Poles are stalwart supporters of the performing arts. In Warsaw, Teatr Wielki (Grand Theater and National Opera; Pl. Teatralny 1; Tel. [692 02 00]; <www.teatrwielki.pl>) is the foremost venue in Poland for opera and ballet; Kiri Te Kanawa, Kathleen Battle, and José Carreras have all sung here. For classical music concerts, the National Philharmonic Hall (ul. Jasna 5; Tel. [826 72 81]) and the intimate Opera Kameralna (Al. Solidarno§ci 76; Tel. [625 75 10]) are among the nation’s best. There are also occasional concerts at the Royal Castle on Pl. Zamkowy (Tel. [657 21 70]). In Kraków, Slowacki Theater (Pl. •w. Ducha 1; Tel. [423 17 00]) is the venue for opera, as well as theater and concerts; for theater and dance, Operetta Stage (ul. Lubicz 48; Tel. [421 16 30]); and for music events, the recently renovated Philharmonic Hall (ul. Zwierzyniecka 1; Tel. [422 43 12]). Concerts are also held at St. Mary’s Cathedral, St. Peter & Paul Church on Wawel Hill and in summer at the Chopin Monument in Lazienki Park. In Gdansk, the State Baltic Opera (Al. Zwyciestwa 15; Tel. [341 05 63]; www.operabaltycka.pl) is one of the best in Poland, and it holds opera and symphonic concerts, while chamber music concerts are held at the Baltic Philharmonic Hall (Olowianka 1; Tel. [305 20 40]). Just outside Gdansk, in Sopot, the Opera Le§na is an open-air theater for classical and popular music. In Poznan, opera is performed at the Teatr Wielki (ul. Aleksandra Fredry 9; Tel. [852 82 91]) and classical music at Filharmonia Poznanska (ul. •w. Marcina 81; Tel. [852 47 08]). Poznan is also well known for its acclaimed, long-running ballet company, The Polish Dance Theater-Poznan Ballet (ul. Kozia 4; Tel. [852 42 41]).

Dramatic plays are staged almost entirely in Polish, tending to exclude most foreign tourists. Acting and directing are of a very high standard, though, and adventurous theatergoers who don’t mind not understanding the language in order to see first-rate acting and production will find plenty of excellent performances, especially in Kraków, the epicenter of the Polish theater world. The Stary Teatr, or Old Theater (ul. Jagiellonska 1; Tel. [422 40 40]) is the top venue, with a main stage and two ancillary stages. In Warsaw, top musicals of the Andrew Lloyd Weber variety land at Roma (ul. Konopnickiej 6); the Narodowy, or National Theater (Pl. Teatralny 1) that was recently renovated from head to toe after a devastating fire.

Casinos. Casinos Poland runs gaming facilities in hotels in three cities covered in this guide: in Warsaw, Hotel Marriott (Al. Jerozolimskie 65/79; Tel. [630 63 06]); in Kraków, Hotel Continental (Novotel) (Al. Armii Krajowej 11; Tel. [637 50 44]); and in Poznan, Hotel Merkury (ul. Roosevelt 20; Tel. [855 80 00]). In Warsaw, there are also casinos at the Dom Chlopa Hotel (Powstanców Warszawy 2; Tel. [827 58 10]); Polonia Hotel (Al. Jerozolimskie 45; Tel. [622 31 23]); and Victoria Hotel (ul. Królewska 11; Tel. [827 66 33]).

Golf. If you’ve just got to play golf on your business trip to Warsaw, head for the First Warsaw Golf and Country Club (Rajszew 70; Tel. [782 45 55]; <golfclub@it.com.pl>), an 18-hole course about 30 km (19 miles) outside of the capital. Perhaps the best golfing is near the Baltic Sea, at the Gdansk Golf and Country Club in Postolów (Tel. [682 83 71]).

Horseback-riding. Equestrian holidays are increasingly popular in Poland; ask your travel agent about Orbis horseback-riding vacations. If you just want to get in the saddle a time or two, contact: Pa-ta-Taj Horse-Riding School (Szkola Jazdy Konnej) (ul. Krótka 9, Tel. [758 58 35]) or Sport and Recreation (Limanki, 26 Luze, Tel. [792 08 42]) in Warsaw. There are a couple of dozen stables and riding schools in the environs of the capital; ask for additional information from Tourist Information Centers or your hotel. 

Swimming and Water Sports. In Warsaw, the Victoria, Marriott, and Bristol hotels have pools. Less ritzy are these pools: Spartanska (ul. Spartanska 1, Tel. [848 67 46]), OSIR (ul. Kasprzaka 1, Tel. [631 48 67]), and Merlini’s Water Park (ul. Merliniego, Tel. [854 01 30]). Kraków also has several pools open to visitors: Wodny Water Park (ul. Dobrego Pasterza 126, Tel. [413 73 99]), Sofitel Hotel (ul. M. Konopnickiej 28, Tel. 261 92 12), and Korona (ul. Kalwaryjska 9, Tel. [656 13 68]).

Football (soccer). Football is Poland’s most popular spectator sport. Warsaw’s two first-division football teams are Legia Warszawa (ul. Lazienkowska 3, Tel. [628 43 03]) and Polonia Warszawa (ul. Konwiktors,a 6, Tel. [635 14 01]).

To begin with the most obvious option, the Warsaw Zoo (ul. Ratuszowa 1-3, Tel. [619 40 41], <www.warszawa.um .gov.pl./zoo>) has been going strong since 1928. The habitats of some 4000 animals, including Siberian tigers, kangaroos, cheetahs, crocs, snow leopards, and an unusual red panda are spread across 40 hectares (99 acres). The zoo also has a free-flight bird hall. Another option in the capital for small children is the Baj Puppet Theater (ul. Jagiellonska 28, Tel. [818 08 21]) housed in a former Jewish school in Praga, across the river from Old Town. Playgrounds — the kind with tunnels, jungle gyms, and inflatable cages filled with rubber balls — are found in the capital: Stratosfera (ul. Ostrobramska 75c, Tel. [611 35 83]); Kolorado Ursynów (ul. Herbsta 4, Tel. [664 88 77]).

For kids with energy to burn, there are water parks and swimming pools (see above) in summer and ice rinks in winter. To go ice skating, check out the Stegny Skating Track (Tor Lyzwiarski Stegny), (ul. Inspektowa 1, Tel. [842 27 68]) or Torwar (ul. Lazienkowska, Tel. [621 44 71]) in Warsaw. Another activity that is all the rage is paintball, and there are multiple fields where you can inflict paint rather than pain. Try Marcus-Graf (ul. Widok 10, in Beniaminów near Warsaw; Tel. [816 10 08]), TM Pretor (ul. Zaaruskiego 6, Warsaw; Tel. [838 25 35]), Rival Paintball Guns (ul. Bartosika 10/77, Warsaw; Tel. [671 22 63]), or Extreme Sports (ul. Klaudyny 18/5, Warsaw; Tel. [833 73 73]). Paintballers in Kraków should check out Ultimate Sports (near fort Bodzanów; Tel. [431 20 61]). 

Another fast-paced sport is go-karts. In Warsaw, race the kids over to Imola, where they also feature paintball (ul. Pulawska 33, Piaseczno; Tel. [648 27 14]). If your kids like bowling, you’ll find facilities in all the major cities. One place they’re sure to like in Kraków is Atomic World Entertainment Center (ul. Zakopianska 62; Tel. 261 31 14), which not only has swanky lanes but loads of video games, billiards, and air hockey. In the Malta lake district of Poznan, there are many facilities ideal for children, including a manmade ski slope and a exhilerating toboggan run.

Beyond the park lies the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, famous as the scene of the 1960s “Summer of Love,” when thousands of flower-children flocked into the city. Today you are more likely to spot yuppies than hippies shopping in the clothing boutiques and record stores, although a number of homeless youth and posturing teens hang out on the sidewalks seeking spare change. For a guided tour of the high points, check out the 2-hour Haight-Ashbury Flower Power Walking Tour offered Tuesdays and Saturdays at 9:30am (Tel. [415/221-8442]).

You can drive to the vineyards from San Francisco via Interstate 80, across the Bay Bridge, but bus tours are also available through the major providers. You can also arrange a custom tour, visiting wineries of your choice, through Wine Country Jeep Tours (Tel. [800/539-5337], toll-free in US). The Napa Valley Wine Train is another option for a scenic hands-off chug through the valley, including lunch or dinner, but no winery visits.

The rugged coast continues south for another 65 miles (105 km) along to San Simeon, where William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper magnate immortalized by Orson Welles in the film Citizen Kane, built his unbelievable dream castle on a hilltop high above the sea. Hearst Castle now forms the centerpiece of the Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument, and is one of the most popular attractions in all California (guided tours only). Allow at least two hours for a tour — you can book one at the Visitor Center, but it’s advisable to make an advance reservation, especially during the summer, by phoning Destinet at [(800) 444-4445]; group tours [(800) 401-4775] (both toll-free in US).

At the Broadway Street edge of the Gaslamp Quarter, you can’t miss Horton Plaza, one of the best modern shopping malls in the United States. Along with six floors of shops and restaurants, open-air terraces, and quirky decorations, visitors will find the local half-price ticket booth, Times Arts Tix (Tel. [619/497-5000]). Broadway ends at the harbor, where visitors can visit one of several 19th-century ships moored on the Embarcadero and belonging to the excellent Maritime Museum.

The exception is in Acapulco. The Centro de Convenciones offers arguably the best Fiesta Mexicana in the country, and is the closest you’ll come to an authentic display of Mexican culture and dance. Along with beautifully performed folkloric dances from all over Mexico, you’ll witness a pre-Hispanic ceremony called Los Voladores de Papantla, which represents an invocation to the four cardinal points and a prayer for fertility; a floreador roping exhibition; and the vibrant sounds of the mariachi. This fiesta is held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 7 to 10pm. Reservations are recommended, to ensure a good table. For reservations, call Tel. [(7) 484-7046].

In Puerto Vallarta one fiesta that stands out from the rest is not a traditional Fiesta Mexicana at all, but an evening at the secluded Caletas cove, accessible only by boat. Ritmos de la Noche (“Rhythms of the Night”) is a truly magical experience. You travel by fast catamarans to the former home of John Huston, where you’ll be greeted by native drums and abundant tiki torches — there is no electricity here — then dine by candlelight at tables set along the secluded beach. Following dinner, the jungle, sounds of nature, and a replica of a pyramid are the backdrop for a performance of pre-Hispanic dances with a unique contemporary choreographic twist. The show is held from Monday through Saturday. Call Tel. [(3) 221-0657], for reservations.

Golf. The area from Punta Mita on the northern tip of Banderas Bay to Manzanillo in the south is beginning to rival Los Cabos as Mexico’s golf mecca. Six exceptional golf courses are located here, notable not only for their challenging designs coupled, with ocean and jungle views, but also for their absence of crowds and reasonable prices. The newest is the Jack Nicklaus–designed course at the Four Seasons Punta Mita (Tel. [(3) 291-6000]) located 30 minutes north of Puerto Vallarta, notable for a spectacular hole that drives to a natural island 175 yards offshore. Currently, it is open only to guests of the Four Seasons, or members of other golf clubs with a letter of introduction. Two other courses are located near Puerto Vallarta: Club de Golf Flamingos (Tel. [(3) 298-0606]), a casual course open to the public, and the Joe Finger–designed course at the Marina Vallarta Golf Club (Tel. [(3) 221-0073]). Four new courses are scheduled to open in the surrounding area by mid 2001.

Traveling south along the Costa Alegre, two spectacular courses offer exclusive play and multiple ocean views. Isla Navidad (Tel. [(3) 355-5103]) is one of Mexico’s top-rated resort courses, designed by Robert Von Hagge. It features wide-open fairways and big greens, with plenty of water, including eight oceanside holes. The course at El Tamarindo (Tel. [(3) 551-5031]) may not be as renown as the others, but it is a lush beauty of a course set in a tropical rainforest by the sea. The approaches to the holes wind through jungle paths, and fairways and greens are gently worked into the mountainous terrain bordering the Pacific Ocean.

In Manzanillo, golf is an integral part of the Las Hadas resort where La Mantarray golf course (Tel. [(3) 334-0000]), designed by Roy and Pete Dye, is considered among the most scenic in the world. Compact and challenging, 12 of the 18 holes are played over water, including its signature 18th hole, with a drive to an island green.

Further south, Ixtapa has two solid courses: the Robert Trent Jones Jr.–designed Club de Golf Ixtapa Palma Real (Tel. [(7) 553-1062]), and the more challenging Club de Gold Marina Ixtapa (Tel. [(7) 553-1410]), designed by Robert Von Hagge.

Acapulco also offers two golf courses: the Acapulco Princess Golf Course (Tel. [(7) 469-1000]), known for its several water hazards, and designed by Ted Robinson, and the Club de Golf Acapulco (Tel. [(7) 484-0781]), a popular public course located across from the El Cano hotel.

The southernmost golf course is the 18-hole, par 72, Tangolunda Golf Course (Tel. [(9) 58 1-0037]) in Huatulco. It’s a rather small and narrow course, designed by Mario Schjetnan Dantán.

Tennis. Courts are so plentiful, you rarely have to wait to play. All destinations discussed in this book have courts in excellent condition at the higher end hotels, with some offering lighted or covered play, and a range of surfaces. The best tennis facilities are in Puerto Vallarta, where the tennis-aficionado will find two top-class tennis centers. The Continental Plaza Tennis Club, located in the Hotel Continental Plaza (Tel. [(3) 224-0123] ext. 500), offers eight courts, open for play daily from 7am until 10pm. The Iguana Tennis Center (Tel. [(3) 221-0683]), located just off the highway near the entrance to Marina Vallarta, has three courts, one outdoor and two covered, with astro-turf surfaces. Court fees range between US$8 and US$20 per hour. Most tennis courts and many hotels offer racket rentals ranging between US$3 and US$6 per day.

Puerto Vallarta and Banderas Bay have some of the most dramatic diving and snorkeling along the Mexican Pacific Coast. The enormous bay offers sheltered waters that are inhabited by myriad marine creatures. Among the amazing sea life are the giant mantas and eagle mantas that traverse the bay. Dives in the shallower parts of the bay allow a close-up look at thousands of types of tropical fish, including several species endemic to the bay’s waters. Night dives are particularly exciting, offering a chance to discover the thriving nocturnal habitat of Los Arcos, the imposing rock formation that juts out of the southern shore of the bay. Two of the best-reputed dive shops in Vallarta are Vallarta Adventures in Marina Vallarta (Tel. [(3) 221-0657]) and Chico’s Dive Shop (Tel. [(3) 222-1895]). Dive rates in Vallarta range between US$60 and US$120 for a two-tank dive. Quimixto Coves and Los Arcos are the most locally popular dive spots; exceptional diving farther out includes the underwater grottos at the Islas Marietas, and offshore at La Corbeteña.

Deep-sea fishing is excellent all along the Pacific coast. Manzanillo has earned a reputation for being one of the best year-round spots for marlin and sailfish. Winter is best for dorado (also known as mahi-mahi), and in summer wahoo and roosterfish are the main catches. The premier season is from October through February and rates range from US$180 to US$350 for a private fishing charter. Fishing can be arranged through travel agencies or directly at the fishermen’s cooperative (Tel. [(3) 332-1031]), located downtown where the fishing boats are moored.

As sea kayaking continues to grow in popularity, more venues are making it available along Mexico’s Pacific. Many of the eco-conscious tour operators offer sea kayaking expeditions, as do a growing number of upscale hotels. In Puerto Vallarta, contact Open Air Expeditions (Tel. [(3) 222-3310]) for tours guided by professionals. In Huatulco, Shuatur (Tel. [(9) 587-0734]) and Turismo Conejo (Tel. [(9) 587-0029]) are well equipped to arrange excellent sea-kayaking adventures. It is easy to find operators offering water-skis, windsurfing boards, parasailing, and noisy little wave-runners for rent by the hour on the beaches of most hotels.

Puerto Escondido’s Zicatela Beach is considered one of the best surfing beaches in the world, and is the site of an important surfing competition every August. San Blas, located 225 km (150 miles) northwest of Puerto Vallarta, is another good spot for outstanding surfing waves. The best waves along the Mexican coast are caught during the fall. San Blas has a much smaller tourist infrastructure than Puerto Escondido, and word-of-mouth is the best way to learn the secrets of the best beaches and current breaks. Another good option is to contact Surf-Mex (Tel. [(3) 223-1680]), based in Puerto Vallarta, who offer surf tours and lessons, from rank beginners on up to expert wave-riders.

Eco- and adventure-tourism fans will feel they’ve reached nirvana here. With an increasing number of tourists looking for these options, the Mexican Association of Adventure Travel and Eco-tourism (AMTAVE; Tel. [(5) 663-5381], or www.amtave.com.mx) was formed to offer information about the most qualified guides and authentic service providers in each area of Mexico, and can direct you to qualified members in the area.

A word for those enamored of hiking: As a rule, in Mexico there are no marked trails or ranger stations such as you commonly find in the US and Europe. Therefore, it is better to go with a local operator or qualified guide, or contact a company in the US or Europe that can arrange something that fits your ability and sense of adventure. The Sierra Madre Mountains adjacent to Puerto Vallarta offer challenging, yet accessible hiking and mountain biking. Bike-Mex (Tel. [(3) 223-1834]) offers expert guided tours into the mountains and other outlying areas as well as mountain biking expeditions to challenge every rider’s skill level.

Huatulco has turned into somewhat of a haven for travelers looking for activities that not only put their physical fitness to the test but also offer an intense communion with nature. Outstanding river kayaking and river rafting trips take place along the Zimatán and Copatita rivers, with descents from class I to IV. The excitement of the trip is surpassed only by the breathtaking, panoramic views. Huatulco is also the place for rappelling with descents over Punta Celeste, Piedra de Moros, and the Copalitilla waterfalls. For details on the qualified companies offering these and other outdoor activities, contact the Huatulco Visitors Bureau (Tel. [(9) 587-1037]).

Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta are both noted for birdwatching. Manzanillo‘s best birdwatching takes place in the several lagoons that lie along the coastline, especially Laguna de las Garzas, (also know as Laguna de San Pedrito), and Laguna de Cuyutlán — both near the downtown and hotel zones. Both are notable for the variety of species and the abundance of herons and white pelicans. Puerto Vallarta offers several options in surrounding areas, so birdwatchers can opt for mountain or coastal experiences. Nearby is one of the top birdwatching lagoons in America, the Laguna del Quelele. The offshore Marietas Islands offer the rare opportunity to sight Blue- (and Yellow-) Footed Booby Birds. Open Air Expeditions (Tel. [(3) 222-3310]), offers some of the better-organized tours led by expert guides.

Located 150 miles north of Vallarta is the small coastal town of San Blas, once an important port, but now primarily noted for its abundant birds. The best sightings are along the Tovara River, up to the La Tovava natural springs. Jungle cruises in small boats can be arranged through the Hotel Garza Canela in San Blas (Tel. [(3) 285-0307]), or through any Puerto Vallarta travel agency. In Zihuatanejo, local travel agencies can arrange for day trips to Los Morros de los Pericos island, where a great variety of birds nest.

Whale-watching is an awe-inspiring experience, and the Mexican Pacific is one of the few places in the world that offers an opportunity to view these majestic mammals in their natural habitat. From late November through March, the waters of Banderas Bay become the breeding and calving grounds for hundreds of migrating humpback whales, much to the delight of the hundreds of visitors that enjoy witnessing the breaching, spy-hopping, leaps, and other displays of whale behavior. Eco-conscious tour operators throughout the bay (most are based in Puerto Vallarta) have voluntarily established norms for whale-watching, which allow up-close observation while disturbing them as minimally as possible. Authorized and knowledgeable tour operators include Vallarta Adventure (Tel. [(3) 221-0657]), and Open Air Expeditions (Tel. [(3) 222-3310]). Whales have even been known to swim right alongside Puerto Vallarta’s main boardwalk, the malecón, giving its visitors a special treat.

Another seasonal, and very worthwhile eco-conscious activity, is to participate in the nightly sea turtle releases and watches that take place from August through November along the shores of Banderas Bay, and further south in Mazunte (located between Huatulco and Puerto Escondido). Preservation groups and trained specialists conduct these releases and watches. You participate by helping to collect the turtles’ eggs and taking them to a safe nesting area for incubation. After the baby turtles hatch, they are released back into the ocean. Organized visits to the turtle camps are conducted daily in Mazunte, at the Centro Mexicano de la Tortuga, and in Puerto Vallarta by several of the beachfront hotels and a select group of ecologically oriented tour operators, such as Eco-tours de México (Tel. [(3) 222-6606]).

ATV Jungle Tours are a fun, albeit rowdier way to see the off-the-beaten-path areas surrounding Puerto Vallarta and Huatulco. For details in Huatulco contact Cantera Tours (Tel. [(9) 581-0030]); in Puerto Vallarta call Pathfinders at Chico’s Dive Shop (Tel. [(3) 222-1875]). If you like the adventure of traveling through the jungle, Vallarta Adventure in Puerto Vallarta, offers an extraordinary tour of the Sierra Madre Mountains on board Mercedes Benz all-terrain vehicles (called Unimogs). The tour includes a visit to a secluded beach and a detailed explanation of the flora and fauna of the area.

Lovers of speed and thrill-seekers will enjoy the fast-paced tour along the Papagayo River, 72 km (48 miles) north of Acapulco. Shotover-Jet (Tel. [(7) 484-1154]), travels aboard specially-designed 12-passenger turbo boats, which come screaming up to the face of the canyon, and then make a fast spin before continuing up the river, while making repeated 360° turns. To say that it’s a rush is an understatement, and their eco-conscious pamphlet is good for a chuckle, considering the reality of the experience. They are, however, making new rafting excursions available for those who prefer to experience the Papagayo River a little closer to its natural state.

Contemporary art. Puerto Vallarta offers a unique opportunity to view an excellent cross-section of Latin American art. Works by recognized masters — including contemporaries José Luis Cuevas and Alejandro Colunga — as well as emerging artists, are on display at the numerous art galleries in town. Notable among the galleries are Galería Pacífico (Tel. [(3) 222-1982]) and Galería Rosas Blanca (Tel. [(3) 222-1168]), located downtown; and Galería Flores and Arte de las Americas (Tel. [(3) 221-1985]), in Marina Vallarta. It is important to note that original art is duty free in the US and many European countries, and that most galleries are experts in packing, shipping, and handling.

Some 30 km (20 miles) outside Paris at Marne-la-Vallée, the Disneyland Paris Resort could keep kids happy for several days (see page 80). Fans of the Astérix comics about ancient Gaul and the Romans will enjoy the Parc Astérix theme park, near Autoroute A1 between Roissy (Charles-de-Gaulle airport) and Senlis, open April to October; Tel. [03 44 62 34 34]. France Miniature is a 5-hectare (7.5-acre) relief map of France including model villages, châteaux, and monuments to a scale of 1:30 (RER train to St-Quentin-en-Yvelines, then bus; open daily, 15 March–15 November).

The hutongs can be toured on your own — on foot, by rented bicycle, or by hiring one of the canopied pedicabs in the area. But most visitors prefer a guided tour. The Beijing Hutong Tourist Agency (Tel. [6615-9097]), which books tours through hotel desks, has a fleet of red-canopied pedicabs led by an English-speaking guide. Its hutong tour combines many of the sights in the Back Lakes District with the opportunity to step inside a courtyard house and talk with its modern-day residents.

A concert at the Palau de la Música (Sant Frances de Paula 2; Tel. [93/268 10 00]), the mondernista masterpiece, is truly a one-of-a-kind experience. It almost doesn’t matter what the performance is, but you might see anything from a chamber concert or opera soloist to a show by Lou Reed or Tindersticks. Barcelona’s famous opera house, Gran Teatre del Liceu (La Rambla, 51-59; Tel. [93/412 35 32] and [93/485 99 13]; <www.liceubarcelona.com>), was completely gutted by fire in January 1994, but, amazingly, reopened to general acclaim in winter 1999. It competes with the new Auditori de Barcelona (c/ de Lepant, 150), which has several venues and a myriad of classical music and other performances (Tickets, Tel. [902/101 212] or <www.obc.es>).

The city also subsidizes concerts, from rock to classical, in the Plaça de Catalunya and neighborhood parks. One of the best events put on in the city is Grec, an annual festival of international dance, music, and theater. From the last week of June to the end of the first week in August the cultural calendar is full of everything from American blues to Brazilian samba and avant-garde Belgian dance (for a schedule of events and ticket information: Tel. [93/301 77 75]; <www .grecbcn.com>).

Barcelona is hardly Madrid or Seville when it comes to tablaos—live flamenco performances, though a few shows target the tourist trade: Tablao Flamenco Cordobés (Las Ramblas, 35; Tel. [93/317 66 53]) is the most popular and predictable, while El Patio Andaluz (Aribau, 242; Tel [93/209 33 78]) also puts on sevillanas, more traditional southern-style singing and dancing. There are also flamenco shows twice nightly, except Monday, at El Tablao de Carmen in the Poble Espanyol on Montjuïc (Arcos, 9; tel. [93/325 68 95]). 

A company called Un Cotxe Menys (the name means “one fewer car” in Catalan) offers easygoing, enjoyable Barcelona-by-bike tours around La Ribera, the Gothic Quarter, and the waterfront (one includes dinner). Evening outings include drinks and even dinner (Tel. [93/268 21 05] or [93/207 08 96] for more information). On Tibidabo, the Carretera de las Aiguas, a dirt path that winds along the mountain for several miles, with spectacular views of the city below, is a great place to walk, jog, or bicycle.

At the Reial Club de Golf El Prat near the airport, 27 holes provide three different circuits. Clubs and carts may be rented, and there’s a pool for spouses and children. Other nearby courses are at Sant Cugat, off the A-7 motorway just west of the city beyond Tibidabo, and the Terramar course near Sitges, about an hour’s drive away. For sailing information, you can contact the Reial Club Marítim (Tel. [93/315 00 07]).

Skiing is one of the most popular sports in Catalonia. Each year brings new developments in the Pyrenees, most within two hours of Barcelona: Núria, at 1,963 meters (6,439 feet); La Molina, whose slopes rise to 2,537 meters (8,321 feet); and Vallter, with 12 slopes and a top station at 2,500 meters (8,200 feet). Information on the conditions of roads and slopes can be obtained from the Associació Catalana d’Estacions d’Esquí (Tel. [93/416 09 09]).

Barcelona is an excellent city for children. Besides the city beaches, the Port Vell waterfront has L’Aquàrium, the largest aquarium in Europe (along the Moll d’Espanya; Tel. [93/221 74 74]), a 3-D Imax movie theater (Tel. [902/33 22 11]), and lots of adolescent diversions in the Maremagnum mall—even getting there, crossing the wooden drawbridge Rambla del Mar, is fun. The Zoo (Parc Zoológic, on Ciutadella Park, Tel. [93/221 25 06]), has the world’s only albino gorilla in captivity. Poble Espanyol (Avda. del Marqués de Comillas, on Montjuïc), a re-creation of a Spanish village with architectural styles from all over Spain, is very popular with families. The amusement parks on both Montjuïc and Tibidabo (Parc d’Atraccions) are very entertaining, and kids love to arrive at the former via aerial cable car (see page 69). 

Boat builder Nathaniel Hichborn, Revere’s cousin, lived in what is now the Pierce-Hichborn House, one of the city’s earliest brick Georgians built in 1711. On most days, there are two guided tours (details available from the Paul Revere House; Tel. [523-2338] for more information).

Head west down Commercial and Causeway streets, and you will soon reach North Station and the site of the old Boston Garden, the beloved arena for the Bruins ice hockey and the Celtics basketball teams until 1995. FleetCenter (Tel. [624-1000] for information on events) has now replaced it.

There’s not that much to do or see on the seven islands that make up Boston Harbor Islands State Park, but an afternoon spent here offers gentle strolls, picnics, and bird-watching — a welcome respite from urban frenzy. From May to mid-October, the Boston Harbor Cruise Company (Tel. [723-7800]) operates a ferry from Long Wharf to Georges Island, the core of the group. Fort Warren, a 19th-century star-shaped fortress in which Confederate prisoners were incarcerated during the Civil War occupies most of the island. It’s an atmospheric and spooky place, with old gun emplacements, lookout posts, and chilly alleys.

The best way to reach both towns and to tour the sites is by car (half an hour or 14 miles/22 km west of Boston on Route 2 and Route 4/225). You can see the main historical sights in a day, but you’ll need a second visit to appreciate Concord’s rich literary heritage. During the summer and every year on Patriot’s Day (see page 91), battles are staged, and the militiamen demonstrate their drill. Call [(978) 369-3120] for further details.

In summer, it is incredibly crowded, and so if you can, you should avoid the Friday evening mass exodus, (see page 105) and visit during the week or off-season when it’s only an hour from Boston to Sandwich, the nearest town on the Cape. With so many alluring inns, however, why not plan to stay overnight, but make sure to reserve in advance. Provincetown is right at the end of the Cape and in summer can most easily be reached from Boston via the ferry operated by Bay State Cruise Company (Tel. [748-1428]).

Teatro Tapia (Tel. [721-0169]) in Old San Juan and the Centro de Bellas Artes (Tel. [725-7337]) in the suburb of Santurce hold regular performances that range from traditional ballet to classical theater to modern works by today’s most prodigious talents. Teatro La Perla (Tel. [843-4080]) in Ponce also has a full card of performances, especially at festival time.

The LeLoLai VIP initiative is a package of benefits that offers discounts at many attractions, and participating hotels, restaurants, and shops. The package costs just $10, but the savings can be more than $2,500 if you endeavor to use all the coupons. The package must be purchased after your arrival in Puerto Rico. Contact the Casita Tourist Office on your arrival, or call [723-3135] or 800-STAR (in the US) for more details.

Although it’s not Las Vegas, you will find casinos at all the major resort areas around the island. The majority are concentrated on the Condado/Isla Verde strip. The Condado Plaza on Ashord Avenue (Tel. [721-1000]) and the El San Juan Hotel in Isla Verde (Tel. [791-0390]) are two.

The Puerto del Rey Marina near Fajardo has one of the largest charter-boat bases in the Caribbean — here you can arrange for a bare-boat charter, or a day-sail or power-boat rental. (They also service the San Juan area.) The Caribbean School of Aquatics in San Juan (Tel. [728-6606]) has a 50-ft (15-m) catamaran for day sails. In La Parguera you can rent small power boats to explore the mangrove swamps, including Lovers Hole and the phosphorescent bay.

Puerto Rico’s natural and unspoiled interior offers lots of opportunity to get away from the city and commune with nature. With such a wealth of different environments to enjoy, it’s well worth making the effort to leave your hotel. El Yunque (the Caribbean National Forest), southeast of San Juan, is crisscrossed by numerous trails. The hike from the visitors center to La Mina Falls and back takes about an hour, but there are longer trails if you want to spend a whole day out. Stop by the El Portal Tropical Forest Center before setting out; guides are available, but you must request one in advance (Tel. [888-1880]).

Museo del Niño (Plazuela de las Monjas, opposite San Juan Cathedral; Tel. [722-3791]). An engaging hands-on museum designed just for children. Open Tue–Thur 9am– 3:30pm, Fri 9am–5pm, Sat and Sun 12:30–5pm.

Theater: Ancient Greeks were credited with inventing drama and comedy in the theater, and this tradition carries on into the present. The city boasts around 50 theaters and the season is a popular one lasting from October to May. Most of the performances are in Greek. The Athens Festival runs from May to September with a full program of cultural events ranging from choral concerts to dance to recitals with performances aimed at visitors as well as Athenians. For details of the program contact the Greek National Tourist Board at Odos Voukourestiou 1, Tel. [01-9694500].

The following theaters stage performances for tourists, or performances that would appeal to international audiences. The National Theater and Concert Hall, Tel. [01-7282333], more commonly known as the Megaron, is situated on Vas. Sofias, next to the Megaro Mousikis Metro station. It has a program of new and established works in addition to choral, opera, and other musical performances by Greek and international musicians and dance groups.

The Roman Odeon of Herodes Atticus near the Acropolis holds classical performances on summer evenings. The seating has been renovated so there is no fear of sitting on worn stone, but this is perhaps your greatest opportunity to view a performance as the ancients did. Tel. [01-3232771] for details.

Lycabettus Theater on Mount Lycabettus also holds regular summer performances but is less likely to be internationally oriented. For program details, Tel. [01-7227233].

Sound and Light Show: The history of the Acropolis is brought to life through dancing lights and an informative narration, and the surrounding darkness really allows you to study the beauty of the Parthenon. This is a must for all visitors. Performances take place nightly May to October in English at 9pm. Tel. [01-3225904] for details.

Traditional Music and Dance: Greece has a rich legacy of folk dance and music, though genuine performances are becoming more difficult to find, particularly in the capital. Dora Stratou Folk Dance Theater presents performances of traditional Greek song, dance, and music at a traditional “folk-village”-type auditorium on Philopappos Hill from May to September — daily except Mondays. Tel. [01-3244395] for ticketing details and prices.

The proximity of Athens to the coast offers a great opportunity to combine beach activities with a city vacation. Traveling by taxi from a downtown hotel, it only takes 30 minutes to find some excellent facilities. Much of Athens closes down during the heat of August (though not those relating to tourism) and many people head to the coast for the cooler air, therefore you find the resorts very busy at this time. The season is short, with many hotels opening in May and closing again in September. The closest resort to the city is Glyfáda, only 12 km (7 miles) from the city. Its proximity to Athens makes it extremely busy, especially on weekends and it lies very close to the approach to the old airport, which in the past resulted in a lot of aircraft noise. Twenty kilometers (12 miles) away is Voúla, a little less crowded than Glyfáda. Vouliagméni is 5 km (3 miles) further south, and a haunt for the local Athens jet-set because of the spa situated at the sulphur lake that gives the resort its name. For more details about spa treatments, Tel. [01-8960341]. There are a number of luxury hotels situated here. Each of these resorts has a Greek Tourist Board–approved beach with changing facilities, food, and watersports. There is a small entrance fee.

For those whose city hotel doesn’t have a pool the following two hotels allow non-guests to enjoy the facilities for an admission fee — the Athens Hilton 46, Vas, Sofias Ave, Tel. [01-7720201]; and the Caravel Hotel, Vas, Alexandras Ave, Tel. [01-7290731].

Sailing: Weekend and summer sailing is very popular with Athenians as the crowded marinas such as those at Pireaus testify. Tournaments occur regularly throughout the summer, and even the children have their own league competitions. Several companies have boats to rent — with crew or “bare” if you have a skipper’s certificate. Contact the Hellenic Sailing Federation, Odos Xenofondos 15, Tel. [01-3235560] for more details.

Fishing: You don’t need to be a professional angler to enjoy a relaxing day’s fishing. Just about every male over the age of five can be found sitting on the sea wall waiting for a bite and it is amazingly relaxing to be letting the rod do all the work. Or you can rent a small boat and head out into deeper water. Contact the Amateur Anglers and Maritime Sports Club at Moutsopoulou Quay, Tel. [01-4515731] for more details.

Golf: There is an 18-hole golf course at Glyfáda, Tel. [01-9846820].

Snow Skiing: The nearest facilities can be found at Mount Parnassus (from December–March), a two-hour drive from the city. The hotels of Delphi and Arachova lie only twenty minutes from the slopes if you want a village atmosphere. Contact the Greek Alpine Club at Arachova, Tel. [01-2324555] for more details.

As in any major city, Athens has sporting facilities in the form of private clubs and community centers. The Olympic Athletic Center of Athens at Odos Kifisias 37, Marousi (Tel. [01-6834060]) has a range of excellent facilities including nine swimming pools, basketball courts, and a velodrome — all for use during the 2004 Olympic Games.

In the theme park itself, Main Street U.S.A., recapturing the traditions of small-town America at the turn of the century, leads to four other “lands” — Frontierland, Adventureland, Fantasyland, and Discoveryland. Each themed section, constantly renewing its attractions, has a variety of fun experiences to offer. Hosts Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Goofy, Donald Duck, and Pluto wander around in their familiar costumes, posing with visitors but never speaking. Every day at 3pm there’s a spectacular all-singing, all-dancing parade including floats inspired by the famous Disney movies. For further information, telephone [(01) 64 74 30 00].

You can book tickets for performances on your arrival but popular acts or plays may sell out quickly. The VVV issues a What’s on in Amsterdam magazine on a monthly basis which lists the performances taking place each day. The easiest way to book tickets for performances before you arrive in town is through the Amsterdam Uit Bureau (AUB-Uitlijn). They produce a publication called Culture in Amsterdam with a listing of major performances. Contact them at Tel. [621 1211] and have your credit cards ready. Tickets can be posted to your home address or will be kept at the AUB office in Leidseplein for you to collect.

The Holland Festival is a program of art events which take place all over the country throughout June. In Amsterdam the parks and pleins are filled with organized activities, and many galleries and concert halls hold coordinated events. A special ticket line will provide information about the festival activities, and tickets if you pay by credit card (Tel. [627 6566]).

The Amsterdam Casino at Max Euweplein off Leidseplein offers the opportunity for adults to gamble (Tel. [620 1006]). Open every day from 1:30pm.

There are many wooded and park areas around the city where it’s possible to take a simple stroll or enjoy other outdoor activities. Amsterdam Bos (city woodland and recreational area), is the largest and most varied and offers a lake for rowing, bridleways for horse rides, and tracks for cycling — you could hire a bike and spend the day here. Many Amsterdammers go running, frisbeeing, or simply take the dog for a walk. The stables at Amsterdam Bos offer woodland rides, a perfect way to clear the city air from your system (contact Manege de Amsterdamse; Tel. [643 1432]).

With so much water around the city, it’s not surprising that water-based sports are very popular. Even on the canals in the city center you’ll find pedalos (sometimes called water cycles) to rent so that you can see the sights on your own steam. Contact them on Tel. [626 5574]; fax 624 1033. You can also captain your own boat to explore the area. Canal Motorboats BV has two locations in the city; Tel. [422 7070] for information and reservations.

On the wider waterways outside the old part of town you will find rowing clubs and sailing clubs which take to the open water in good weather all year round. Out on the IJsselmeer (the inland waterway what was the Zuider Zee) on any sunny weekend you’ll see hundreds of white sails breaking the horizon. Boats can be hired for trips out on the water from Monnikendam or you can take a trip on a crewed boat, although you’ll need to make a booking well in advance. Contact Monnickendam Zeilcharters at ‘t Prooyen 4a, 1141 VD Monnickendam; Tel. [0299 652351]; fax 0299 653618; e-mail <hzc@sailing.nl>.

Despite spending more time than most people riding bicycles, cycling for fun is one of the major recreational activities of the Dutch. Cycle routes parallel most roadways making longer journeys relatively easy, and sporting groups or families will head out to villages like Monnikendam or Marken. Closer to the city, a ride through Vondelpark gives you a feeling of being out of the city. If you would like to tour with a group either in the city or surrounding countryside, you should contact Yellow Bike Guided Tours, Nieuwezijds Kolk 29; Tel. [620 6940], fax 620 7140. They operate daily tours with English guides between April and October.

Classical. The Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra gives excellent concerts at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in the Music Center, and performs open-air “Symphonies under the Stars” at the Hollywood Bowl in the summer. There are also regular recitals and concerts at Royce Hall on the UCLA campus. The San Francisco Symphony performs at Davies Hall from September through July. For less formal concerts, look into Old First Presbyterian Church on Sacramento Street at Van Ness Avenue (Tel. [415/474-1608]). Tickets are modestly priced and the cable car will take you to within two blocks of the church.

Jazz. Try to take in some of this quintessential American musical style. San Francisco has many bars, restaurants, and clubs offering live jazz in the evening, and occasionally at Sunday lunchtime, too — “jazz brunch” is becoming something of a Sunday institution on the West Coast. Try Jazz at Pearl’s in North Beach (Tel. [415/291-8255]) or Yoshi’s in Oakland (Tel. [510/238-9200]). The San Francisco Bay Guardian is an excellent source for listings.

Among dozens of local live theater groups in San Francisco, the American Conservatory Theater (415 Geary Street; Tel. [415/749-2228]) has acquired the widest national reputation. Its repertory season runs from September through June. Broadway hits appear next door at the Curran Theater or a few blocks away at the Golden Gate Theater and Orpheum. All three venues share the same telephone number (Tel. [415/551-2000]). In summer there’s free Shakespeare in Golden Gate Park.

Horseback riding. There are numerous good stables and horse-riding schools just outside Budapest, and riding holidays around the Balaton area and farther aﬁeld are on offer at Budapesti Equestrian Club (tel. [313-5210]) and Petoreházy Club Hotel (tel. 176-5937). Ask Tourinform for details, pay a visit to the aptly-named Pegazus Tours on Fereciek tere, or see the IBUSZ brochure, Riding in Hungary.

Squash. The City Squash Club situated at Márcibányi tér 13 (near Moszvka tér) hires out racquets, balls, and even shoes (tel. [325-0082]).

From the right-hand side of the road, well-marked trails lead through the vegetation and out toward the coast, just a few hundred meters away (a line of casuarina trees marks the spot). Wooden walkways lead you farther out over a tidal mangrove swamp to Gold Rock Beach. One of the most beautiful beaches on the island, Gold Rock must really be seen at low tide to appreciate its full glory. At high tide a shallow layer of water, only a couple of inches deep, covers much of the beach, leaving only a narrow arc of sand above the waterline. This whole area can also be explored by bicycle or kayak or by taking an eco-tour. One of the companies that offers both eco- and cultural tours of the area is East End Adventures (Tel. [373-6662]; e-mail <safari@batalnet.bs>).

New Plymouth is the largest town on the cay. It really has only one main route, Parliament Street, which is full of trim and brightly painted wooden homes with picket fences. As you walk down the street you’ll hear the sounds of daily activity floating through the open windows, occasionally a radio station with news, or maybe evangelical songs. You can browse in the general stores and souvenir shops or visit one of the small art galleries that sell original works and prints by local artists. On the left as you walk away from the harbor you’ll find the Memorial Sculpture Garden, dedicated to the brave settlers who founded New Plymouth. A little farther along, on the right, the Albert Lowe Museum, in an 18th-century house, is brim full of artifacts and knickknacks, maps, and newspaper articles that tell the story of New Plymouth. Lowe was a sailor and prominent shipbuilder. The house is now owned by Roland Alton Lowe, a descendant of Albert and an acclaimed Bahamian painter; his paintings and prints are sold at the museum. Abaco Gold necklaces, bracelets, and rings — including some with turtle and conch shell motifs — are sold at the Sand Dollar Shoppe on Parliament Street (Tel. [365-4221]).

Disney World is about 20 miles southwest of Orlando off Interstate Highway 4. It is open daily, and far into the night at peak periods. For information on the latest opening times, ticket prices, and information, call [(407) 824-4321].

Sea World, 12 miles (19 km) southwest of Orlando at I-4 and the Bee Line Expressway, is minutes away from Disney World. It’s open daily, and the admission charge covers all shows. For information call [(407) 351-3600].

Orlando Flextickets offer a combination ticket for Sea World, Universal Studios, and the Wet-and-Wild water complex in Orlando; for details call [800-224-3838] of consult the Universal Studios’ website, <www.usf.com>.

Aside from traditional acoustic music, Cuba revels in salsa and jazz. Probably the best place for live jazz and salsa in the country is the rollicking Palacio de la Salsa, in Havana’s slightly dated Hotel Riviera (Paseo y Malecón, in Vedado; Tel. [33-4501]). There, from midnight on, Cuba’s very best salsa bands perform (dancing is very much in order), and jazz artists entertain drinkers in the adjacent bar from Thursday to Sunday from 9pm.

The Tropicana in Havana (Calles 72 and 43, Marianao; Tel. [33-7507]), founded in 1939 in a dazzling open-air arena, is indisputably the queen of cabarets. The likes of Nat King Cole performed here in pre-revolutionary times. With a 32-piece orchestra and a cast of over 200 (some parading in impossibly large headdresses), the sheer scale of the spectacle will make your head spin. The show regularly kicks off at 9:30pm, and a shorter performance follows later; there are also a restaurant and disco. Reservations and transportation can be arranged at your hotel for US$60. You can always visit independently, but the venue, situated in the suburb of Marianao, is tricky to find, and you might arrive only to find no tickets remaining. Havana’s next-best cabaret show, smaller and less expensive, is Cabaret Parisien, at the Hotel Nacional (Calles 21 and O, Vedado; Tel. [30-3564]), nightly at 10:30pm; admission is US$35.

The Gran Teatro in Havana, at Calles Prado and San Rafael (Tel. [61-2360]), has two main concert halls and puts on a wide repertoire of entertainment, from opera recitals to ballet. It is home to the internationally renowned Ballet Nacional de Cuba; if you hear that the company (or the rather more innovative Ballet de Camagüey) is performing, be sure to snap up tickets. Havana’s International Ballet Festival is held during the last week of October and first week of November.

The general analysis of the consequences of trade and immigration in the textile and apparel industries clearly requires a much more focused application to detailed sectors to provide reliable conclusions. Moreover, and as this volume indicates, the offsetting influences of lean retailing and short-cycle production in comparison with low foreign labor rates must be evaluated by product demand variability, rather than simply making generalizations about aggregate trade and immigration. For instance, the information-integrated channels in retail-apparel-textile are having some of their most significant impact on sourcing among suppliers, domestic and foreign. The low labor costs for sewing and short time to market from Mexico and the Caribbean countries, and the provisions of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (formerly Section 807 and 807a, or currently [9802.00.80]) that establish duties only on the value added to U.S.-produced materials sent out for assembly, all favor sourcing of apparel from south of the U.S. border rather than Asia. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, “U.S. imports of textiles and apparel from China and two of the traditional Big Three Asian suppliers—Hong Kong and Korea—continued to decline in 1996, when these countries together with Taiwan, accounted for 23.4 percent of total sector trade, compared with 38.5 percent in 1991.”6

The sizes of statistical fluctuations familiar from statistical physics scale as the square root of the number of particles, N. Consider tossing a fair coin 10,000 times. The result will be about 50 percent heads, 50 percent tails, with a fluctuation of about 100, which is the square root of 10,000. Thus, a typical fluctuation from 50:50 heads and tails is 100/10,000 or 1 percent. Let the number of coin flips be 100 million, then the fluctuations are its square root, or 10,000. Dividing, 10,[000/100],000,000 yields a typical deviation of .01 percent from 50:50.

Because of wide individual differences, it’s sometimes hard to tell a language disorder from normal variation in language development. If you’re concerned about your child’s language progress, consult a trained speech–language pathologist. The American Speech–Language–Hearing Association (ASHA) maintains a list of certiﬁed speech–language pathologists for referrals. You can contact the association at [(800) 638-8255].
