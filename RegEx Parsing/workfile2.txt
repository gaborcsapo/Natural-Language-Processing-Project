GaudÃ­âs highly personal Casa BatllÃ³ (1[904-1906]) is next door. The curvy contours, unexpected combinations of textures and materials, bright colors, and infinite detail are GaudÃ­ hallmarks, as are his prevalent religious and nationalist symbolism. The Casa BatllÃ³ is said to pay tribute to the patron saint of Catalonia, St. George, and the dragon he valiantly slayed. GaudÃ­ himself left no clues as to his intent. The undulating blue-tile roof indeed looks like a dragonâs scaly hide, while the window balconies could be the skulls and bones of its victims (others have suggested that they are Venetian carnival masks). St. Georgeâs cross and a shaft suggest a spear being thrust into the dragonâs back. Casa BatllÃ³âs faÃ§ade is covered with the bits of broken plate and tile, a decorative technique called trencadis that GaudÃ­ repeatedly employed. GaudÃ­ did not actually build the entire house; he was commissioned to remodel the exterior and interior. The house cannot be visited, as it is owned by the company that makes Chup-a-chups lollipops, but you can hold a private function in GaudÃ­âs emblematic homeÂ âÂ for a significant fee, of course.

For a closer look at all the wide-open spaces, take a train. VIA Rail Canada is the national passenger-train system using the tracks of Canadian Pacific and Canadian National, who devote themselves strictly to more lucrative freight carrying. Serving pretty good food in comfortable diners, with club cars, observation decks, and sleeping cars, VIA takes a leisurely four days from MontrÃ©al to Vancouver. (From MontrÃ©al to Toronto itâs 51â2 hours, faster by train than by road.) You may also want to consider Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (tel. (800) [665-7245], <www.rockymountaineer.com>), which offers daylight trips through the Canadian Rockies.

No tour of Torontoâs civic past and present is complete without a pilgrimage over to Bond Street, south of Dundas, to Mackenzie House, home of Torontoâs first and most celebrated mayor (82 Bond St., tel. (416) [392-6915]). William Lyon Mackenzie, a Dundee-born Scot, lived here after his return from exile for leading a revolt in 1837 (see page 20). In the meticulously restored interior, guides in traditional colonial dress explain the memorabilia of the fiery newspaperman, including the hand-operated flatbed printing press on which he turned out his revolutionary newspaper, The Colonial Advocate.

You may like to drive the more roundabout coast road over to Louisbourg with a side trip to Glace Bay. As an intriguing exercise in modern industrial archaeology, its desolate log cabins and colliery installations have become a coal mining village museum. Take the fascinating trip along the shafts and galleries of the abandoned Ocean Deep Mine, which reaches 17 km (11 miles) under the sea. You can have a coal minerâs meal at the colliery canteen. The great French fortress town of Louisbourg is presented as a splendid national historic park, one of the most elaborate in Canadaâs ambitious reconstruction program. Youâll need a full day to do it justice. After the guided tour, take time to discuss extra details of 18th-century French colonial life with the well-informed and entertaining costumed volunteers performing the roles of fishermen, merchants, soldiers, and craftspeople (Tel. (902) [733-2280], <www.fortresslouisbourg.com>).

Leave the Trans-Canada 11/2 km (1 mile) east of Revelstoke town to drive the winding Summit Road up Mount Revelstoke, 2,120 m (6,370 ft), the only mountain in Canada that you can âclimbâ by car. This is the cozy way to watch the parkâs landscape change from dense lowland forest, through alpine meadows dotted with wild flowers, to the bleak tundra of the high country. From the top you look out over the Columbia and Illecillewaet river valleys and back to the Monashee Mountains. There are no campgrounds inside the park, but if youâre planning to tent overnight along the 65 km (39 miles) of clearly marked hiking-trails, check in with the park administration office in downtown Revelstoke (P.O. Box 350, Revelstoke, B.C. VOE250; tel. [250-837-7500]). This is the place to get your detailed maps and fishing permit. In the creeks and lakes, youâll find an abundance of troutÂ âÂ rainbow, brook, brown, cut-throat, and red-spotted Dolly VardenÂ âÂ as well as whitefish, char, and bass. Nature-lovers may spot elk, moose, and mountain goat, bird-watchers look for grey jay, blue grouse, and golden eagle, while everyone should watch out for black bear.

You can book tickets for performances on your arrival but popular acts or plays may sell out quickly. The VVV issues a Whatâs on in Amsterdam magazine on a monthly basis which lists the performances taking place each day. The easiest way to book tickets for performances before you arrive in town is through the Amsterdam Uit Bureau (AUB-Uitlijn). They produce a publication called Culture in Amsterdam with a listing of major performances. Contact them at Tel. [621 1211] and have your credit cards ready. Tickets can be posted to your home address or will be kept at the AUB office in Leidseplein for you to collect.

The Holland Festival is a program of art events which take place all over the country throughout June. In Amsterdam the parks and pleins are filled with organized activities, and many galleries and concert halls hold coordinated events. A special ticket line will provide information about the festival activities, and tickets if you pay by credit card (Tel. [627 6566]).

The Amsterdam Casino at Max Euweplein off Leidseplein offers the opportunity for adults to gamble (Tel. [620 1006]). Open every day from 1:30pm.

There are many wooded and park areas around the city where itâs possible to take a simple stroll or enjoy other outdoor activities. Amsterdam Bos (city woodland and recreational area), is the largest and most varied and offers a lake for rowing, bridleways for horse rides, and tracks for cyclingÂ âÂ you could hire a bike and spend the day here. Many Amsterdammers go running, frisbeeing, or simply take the dog for a walk. The stables at Amsterdam Bos offer woodland rides, a perfect way to clear the city air from your system (contact Manege de Amsterdamse; Tel. [643 1432]).

With so much water around the city, itâs not surprising that water-based sports are very popular. Even on the canals in the city center youâll find pedalos (sometimes called water cycles) to rent so that you can see the sights on your own steam. Contact them on Tel. 626 5574; fax 624 1033. You can also captain your own boat to explore the area. Canal Motorboats BV has two locations in the city; Tel. [422 7070] for information and reservations.

On the wider waterways outside the old part of town you will find rowing clubs and sailing clubs which take to the open water in good weather all year round. Out on the IJsselmeer (the inland waterway what was the Zuider Zee) on any sunny weekend youâll see hundreds of white sails breaking the horizon. Boats can be hired for trips out on the water from Monnikendam or you can take a trip on a crewed boat, although youâll need to make a booking well in advance. Contact Monnickendam Zeilcharters at ât Prooyen 4a, 1141 VD Monnickendam; Tel. 0299 652351; fax 0[299 6536]18; e-mail <hzc@sailing.nl>.

Despite spending more time than most people riding bicycles, cycling for fun is one of the major recreational activities of the Dutch. Cycle routes parallel most roadways making longer journeys relatively easy, and sporting groups or families will head out to villages like Monnikendam or Marken. Closer to the city, a ride through Vondelpark gives you a feeling of being out of the city. If you would like to tour with a group either in the city or surrounding countryside, you should contact Yellow Bike Guided Tours, Nieuwezijds Kolk 29; Tel. 620 6940, fax [620 7140]. They operate daily tours with English guides between April and October.

Here are some of the most dependable shops on the Out Islands: In Hope Town, Waterâs Edge Studios offers wood carvings by Russ Ervin, and Island Gallery stocks selected handicrafts and souvenirs. Island Made Gift Shop in Gregory Town (Eleuthera; Tel. [335-5369]) has a good supply of Bahamian gifts and crafts. Reliable spots to shop for Abaco Gold are Green Turtle Cay and Marsh Harbour.

The Bahamas Sports and Aviation Information Centre provides complete information about sports facilities in the Bahamas. Call them toll-free at 800-32-SPORT (within the US only) or at [305-932-0051], or write for information to 19495 Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 809, Aventura, Florida 33180, USA.

Wind surfing. With its many shallow lagoons, the Bahamas is a great place for wind surfing. Most large hotels have boards for rent. Para-sailing (soaring overhead in a parachute harness pulled by a speedboat) is also available in New Providence (Cable Beach and Paradise Island) and Grand Bahama (Lucaya), but make sure youâre fully insured before taking to the airÂ âÂ many policies exclude this popular activity. Sea Sports at the Nassau Marriott Resort on Cable Beach has a full compliment of water-sport equipment for rent (Tel. [327-6200]).

Diving and snorkeling. Opportunities for diving and snorkeling in the Bahamas are almost unrivaled in terms of both the quality of the experience and the variety of stunning habitats. The areaâs clear waters and numerous coral reefs and rocky outcrops offer an ideal environment for hundreds of species of fish, as well as turtles, dolphins, and, yes, sharks. A number of dive centers offer transport to the sites along with the assistance of experienced and qualified dive masters. The two main centers on Nassau and Grand Bahama are Nassau Scuba Centre (Tel. 362-1964; fax 362-1198; US Tel. (954) 462-3400; US fax (954) 462-4100; website <http://www.nassau-scuba-centre.com,)> and UNEXSO (Tel. 373-1244; fax 373-8956; US Tel. (954) 351-9889; US fax (954) [351-9740]). Both of these companies also run trips to Andros, Eleuthera, and Exuma. Youâll also find diving and snorkeling opportunities on the main islands of New Providence and Grand Bahama. And there are special places around the Out Islands that offer exceptional experiences, though not much lively entertainment out of the water. Here is a list of particularly exciting sites:

Andros. The barrier reef here is the third longest in the world. At 60 ft (20 m) below the surface, it is for divers only, though snorkelers can splash around in the shallow coastal areas, which are also rich in sea life. Spectacular large fish and sharks are usually sighted here at the âTongue of the Ocean,â which in some places lies only 120 ft (40 m) offshore but drops an amazing 6000 ft (2000 m) to the ocean trench. There are also several âblue holesâÂ âÂ vivid blue ocean holes, some with mazes of tunnels and cavesÂ âÂ to be explored. Small Hope Bay Lodge on Andros offers diving vacations (Tel. 368-2014; fax [368-2015]).

Bimini. At Paradise Point you can explore the formations that are said to be the lost city of Atlantis. Contact Bill and Nowddla Keefeâs Bimini Undersea for information on excursions (Tel. 347-3089; fax [652-9148]; US Tel. (305) 653-5572; US fax (305) [652-9148]).

San Salvador. Because the reef wall here lies only 40 ft (15 m) below the surface, this site is much more accessible for less experienced divers than the Andros reef. Itâs said to be a great place to see groups of hammerhead sharks as well as turtles and huge rays. Contact Riding Rock Inn for information on diving (Tel. 331-2631; fax 331-2020; US Tel. (954) 359-8353; US fax (954) [359-8254]).

Long Island. Shark Reef near Stella Maris is the most famous area in the islands for close encounters with that most feared aquatic creature. Here you can watch the âfeeding frenzyâ of sharks from close quarters. There are also pristine reef walls off Conception Island and Rum Cay. Contact the Stella Maris Resort (Tel. 338-2050; fax 338-2052; US Tel. (954) 359-8236; US fax (954) [359-8238]).

The Abacos. The Cathedral, west of Guana Cay, is a huge cave lit with sunlight streaming through holes in the ceiling; The large entrance makes it relatively safe for novice divers. Walkers Cayâs shark-feeding program allows divers to watch large groups of sharks fight over a frozen fish âchumsickleâ (buckets of fish parts frozen into a block that thaws in the warm water, releasing the fish slowly to prolong the feeding). Contact Walkers Cay Undersea Adventures (Tel. 352-1252; fax 353-1339; US Tel. (954) 462-3400; US fax (954) [462-4100]).

The Exumas. Pick almost any island or islet here for tremendous possibilities. Fast power boats from Nassau whisk visitors on day trips to enjoy the area. The Blue Holes around Stocking Island attract varied fish life. Contact Exuma Fantasea for more information (Tel. and fax [336-2483]).

As a general rule, the larger and more populous islands have the newer and better boats for rent. Prices vary, but a full dayâs charter of a boat and crew averages $400â$500. Half-day rentals are also available. Contact one of the following for additional information: Days Catch Charter, Abaco (Tel. 809/336-0059); Coopers Charter Service, George Town, Exuma (Tel. 809/336-2711); or Peace and Plenty Bonefish Lodge, George Town, Exuma (Tel. 345-5555; fax 345-5556). The Andros Island Bonefishing Lodge is a prime center for bonefishing expeditions (Tel. 368-5167; fax [368-2026]).

For information about sailing rentals contact The Moorings (Tel. 367-4000; fax 367-4004; website <http://www.moorings. com>). Smaller boats for local jaunts can be rented at Sea Horse Boat Rentals, Marsh Harbour, Abacos (Tel. 367-2513; fax 367-2516; website <http://www.sea-horse.com>. Nassau Yacht Haven also has sailboats for rent (Tel. [393-8173]).

The Bahamas has a number of PGA-level courses. Grand Bahama has the well tended Lucaya Golf and Country Club (Tel. 373-1066), and the Bahamas Princess Golf and Country Club, part of the Bahamas Princess Complex at Freeport, has two courses (Tel. 352-6721) both designed by Dick Wilson. New Providence has Paradise Island Golf Club (Tel. 363-3925) and one at Cable Beach (Tel. 327-6000). On Abaco Island, Treasure Beach has an 18-hole course (Tel. [365-8045]).

If you donât sail yourself, this is a great way to see the Bahamas from the water. Even if you canât get out to some of the Out Islands, such as the Exumas, you can sail out to one of the cays near Nassau to get a feel for the atmosphere of the more remote parts of the Bahamas. Top Sail Yacht Cruises takes small parties from the British Colonial Beach Dock to places like Rose Island (Tel. 393-0820). Majestic Tours, at Prince George Dock, has the largest boats (Tel. 322-2606). On Grand Bahama, Superior Watersports offers daily cruises (Tel. [373-7863]).

The casinos at the Marriott Resort on Cable Beach (Tel. 327-6200), Atlantis on Paradise Island (Tel. 363-3000), and the Princess Resort on Grand Bahama (Tel. [352-7811]) all offer roulette, craps, and blackjack as well as slot machines. The slot machines operated 24 hours a day, but there are limited hours for the gaming tables: at Atlantis theyâre open 10amâ4am, at Princess Casino and the Marriott 9amâ3am.

If gambling is not your cup of tea, allow yourself to be dazzled by one of the nightly Las Vegasâstyle floor shows at the Marriott, Atlantis, or the Princess. For information about the Princess cabaret, call 352-6721; for the Marriott Palace Revue, call 327-6200, for the Atlantis, call [363-3000].

Beyond the park lies the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, famous as the scene of the 1960s âSummer of Love,â when thousands of flower-children flocked into the city. Today you are more likely to spot yuppies than hippies shopping in the clothing boutiques and record stores, although a number of homeless youth and posturing teens hang out on the sidewalks seeking spare change. For a guided tour of the high points, check out the 2-hour Haight-Ashbury Flower Power Walking Tour offered Tuesdays and Saturdays at 9:30am (Tel. 415/[221-8442]).

You can drive to the vineyards from San Francisco via Interstate 80, across the Bay Bridge, but bus tours are also available through the major providers. You can also arrange a custom tour, visiting wineries of your choice, through Wine Country Jeep Tours (Tel. 800/[539-5337], toll-free in US). The Napa Valley Wine Train is another option for a scenic hands-off chug through the valley, including lunch or dinner, but no winery visits.

The rugged coast continues south for another 65 miles (105 km) along to San Simeon, where William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper magnate immortalized by Orson Welles in the film Citizen Kane, built his unbelievable dream castle on a hilltop high above the sea. Hearst Castle now forms the centerpiece of the Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument, and is one of the most popular attractions in all California (guided tours only). Allow at least two hours for a tourÂ âÂ you can book one at the Visitor Center, but itâs advisable to make an advance reservation, especially during the summer, by phoning Destinet at (800) 444-4445; group tours (800) [401-4775] (both toll-free in US).

At the Broadway Street edge of the Gaslamp Quarter, you canât miss Horton Plaza, one of the best modern shopping malls in the United States. Along with six floors of shops and restaurants, open-air terraces, and quirky decorations, visitors will find the local half-price ticket booth, Times Arts Tix (Tel. 619/[497-5000]). Broadway ends at the harbor, where visitors can visit one of several 19th-century ships moored on the Embarcadero and belonging to the excellent Maritime Museum.

The exception is in Acapulco. The Centro de Convenciones offers arguably the best Fiesta Mexicana in the country, and is the closest youâll come to an authentic display of Mexican culture and dance. Along with beautifully performed folkloric dances from all over Mexico, youâll witness a pre-Hispanic ceremony called Los Voladores de Papantla, which represents an invocation to the four cardinal points and a prayer for fertility; a floreador roping exhibition; and the vibrant sounds of the mariachi. This fiesta is held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 7 to 10pm. Reservations are recommended, to ensure a good table. For reservations, call Tel. (7) [484-7046].

In Puerto Vallarta one fiesta that stands out from the rest is not a traditional Fiesta Mexicana at all, but an evening at the secluded Caletas cove, accessible only by boat. Ritmos de la Noche (âRhythms of the Nightâ) is a truly magical experience. You travel by fast catamarans to the former home of John Huston, where youâll be greeted by native drums and abundant tiki torchesÂ âÂ there is no electricity hereÂ âÂ then dine by candlelight at tables set along the secluded beach. Following dinner, the jungle, sounds of nature, and a replica of a pyramid are the backdrop for a performance of pre-Hispanic dances with a unique contemporary choreographic twist. The show is held from Monday through Saturday. Call Tel. (3) [221-0657], for reservations.

Golf. The area from Punta Mita on the northern tip of Banderas Bay to Manzanillo in the south is beginning to rival Los Cabos as Mexicoâs golf mecca. Six exceptional golf courses are located here, notable not only for their challenging designs coupled, with ocean and jungle views, but also for their absence of crowds and reasonable prices. The newest is the Jack Nicklausâdesigned course at the Four Seasons Punta Mita (Tel. (3) 291-6000) located 30 minutes north of Puerto Vallarta, notable for a spectacular hole that drives to a natural island 175 yards offshore. Currently, it is open only to guests of the Four Seasons, or members of other golf clubs with a letter of introduction. Two other courses are located near Puerto Vallarta: Club de Golf Flamingos (Tel. (3) 298-0606), a casual course open to the public, and the Joe Fingerâdesigned course at the Marina Vallarta Golf Club (Tel. (3) [221-0073]). Four new courses are scheduled to open in the surrounding area by mid 2001.

Traveling south along the Costa Alegre, two spectacular courses offer exclusive play and multiple ocean views. Isla Navidad (Tel. (3) 355-5103) is one of Mexicoâs top-rated resort courses, designed by Robert Von Hagge. It features wide-open fairways and big greens, with plenty of water, including eight oceanside holes. The course at El Tamarindo (Tel. (3) [551-5031]) may not be as renown as the others, but it is a lush beauty of a course set in a tropical rainforest by the sea. The approaches to the holes wind through jungle paths, and fairways and greens are gently worked into the mountainous terrain bordering the Pacific Ocean.

In Manzanillo, golf is an integral part of the Las Hadas resort where La Mantarray golf course (Tel. (3) [334-0000]), designed by Roy and Pete Dye, is considered among the most scenic in the world. Compact and challenging, 12 of the 18 holes are played over water, including its signature 18th hole, with a drive to an island green.

Further south, Ixtapa has two solid courses: the Robert Trent Jones Jr.âdesigned Club de Golf Ixtapa Palma Real (Tel. (7) 553-1062), and the more challenging Club de Gold Marina Ixtapa (Tel. (7) [553-1410]), designed by Robert Von Hagge.

Acapulco also offers two golf courses: the Acapulco Princess Golf Course (Tel. (7) 469-1000), known for its several water hazards, and designed by Ted Robinson, and the Club de Golf Acapulco (Tel. (7) [484-0781]), a popular public course located across from the El Cano hotel.

Tennis. Courts are so plentiful, you rarely have to wait to play. All destinations discussed in this book have courts in excellent condition at the higher end hotels, with some offering lighted or covered play, and a range of surfaces. The best tennis facilities are in Puerto Vallarta, where the tennis-aficionado will find two top-class tennis centers. The Continental Plaza Tennis Club, located in the Hotel Continental Plaza (Tel. (3) 224-0123 ext. 500), offers eight courts, open for play daily from 7am until 10pm. The Iguana Tennis Center (Tel. (3) [221-0683]), located just off the highway near the entrance to Marina Vallarta, has three courts, one outdoor and two covered, with astro-turf surfaces. Court fees range between US$8 and US$20 per hour. Most tennis courts and many hotels offer racket rentals ranging between US$3 and US$6 per day.

Puerto Vallarta and Banderas Bay have some of the most dramatic diving and snorkeling along the Mexican Pacific Coast. The enormous bay offers sheltered waters that are inhabited by myriad marine creatures. Among the amazing sea life are the giant mantas and eagle mantas that traverse the bay. Dives in the shallower parts of the bay allow a close-up look at thousands of types of tropical fish, including several species endemic to the bayâs waters. Night dives are particularly exciting, offering a chance to discover the thriving nocturnal habitat of Los Arcos, the imposing rock formation that juts out of the southern shore of the bay. Two of the best-reputed dive shops in Vallarta are Vallarta Adventures in Marina Vallarta (Tel. (3) 221-0657) and Chicoâs Dive Shop (Tel. (3) [222-1895]). Dive rates in Vallarta range between US$60 and US$120 for a two-tank dive. Quimixto Coves and Los Arcos are the most locally popular dive spots; exceptional diving farther out includes the underwater grottos at the Islas Marietas, and offshore at La CorbeteÃ±a.

Deep-sea fishing is excellent all along the Pacific coast. Manzanillo has earned a reputation for being one of the best year-round spots for marlin and sailfish. Winter is best for dorado (also known as mahi-mahi), and in summer wahoo and roosterfish are the main catches. The premier season is from October through February and rates range from US$180 to US$350 for a private fishing charter. Fishing can be arranged through travel agencies or directly at the fishermenâs cooperative (Tel. (3) [332-1031]), located downtown where the fishing boats are moored.

As sea kayaking continues to grow in popularity, more venues are making it available along Mexicoâs Pacific. Many of the eco-conscious tour operators offer sea kayaking expeditions, as do a growing number of upscale hotels. In Puerto Vallarta, contact Open Air Expeditions (Tel. (3) 222-3310) for tours guided by professionals. In Huatulco, Shuatur (Tel. (9) 587-0734) and Turismo Conejo (Tel. (9) [587-0029]) are well equipped to arrange excellent sea-kayaking adventures. It is easy to find operators offering water-skis, windsurfing boards, parasailing, and noisy little wave-runners for rent by the hour on the beaches of most hotels.

Puerto Escondidoâs Zicatela Beach is considered one of the best surfing beaches in the world, and is the site of an important surfing competition every August. San Blas, located 225 km (150 miles) northwest of Puerto Vallarta, is another good spot for outstanding surfing waves. The best waves along the Mexican coast are caught during the fall. San Blas has a much smaller tourist infrastructure than Puerto Escondido, and word-of-mouth is the best way to learn the secrets of the best beaches and current breaks. Another good option is to contact Surf-Mex (Tel. (3) [223-1680]), based in Puerto Vallarta, who offer surf tours and lessons, from rank beginners on up to expert wave-riders.

Eco- and adventure-tourism fans will feel theyâve reached nirvana here. With an increasing number of tourists looking for these options, the Mexican Association of Adventure Travel and Eco-tourism (AMTAVE; Tel. (5) [663-5381], or www.amtave.com.mx) was formed to offer information about the most qualified guides and authentic service providers in each area of Mexico, and can direct you to qualified members in the area.

A word for those enamored of hiking: As a rule, in Mexico there are no marked trails or ranger stations such as you commonly find in the US and Europe. Therefore, it is better to go with a local operator or qualified guide, or contact a company in the US or Europe that can arrange something that fits your ability and sense of adventure. The Sierra Madre Mountains adjacent to Puerto Vallarta offer challenging, yet accessible hiking and mountain biking. Bike-Mex (Tel. (3) [223-1834]) offers expert guided tours into the mountains and other outlying areas as well as mountain biking expeditions to challenge every riderâs skill level.

Huatulco has turned into somewhat of a haven for travelers looking for activities that not only put their physical fitness to the test but also offer an intense communion with nature. Outstanding river kayaking and river rafting trips take place along the ZimatÃ¡n and Copatita rivers, with descents from class I to IV. The excitement of the trip is surpassed only by the breathtaking, panoramic views. Huatulco is also the place for rappelling with descents over Punta Celeste, Piedra de Moros, and the Copalitilla waterfalls. For details on the qualified companies offering these and other outdoor activities, contact the Huatulco Visitors Bureau (Tel. (9) [587-1037]).

Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta are both noted for birdwatching. Manzanilloâs best birdwatching takes place in the several lagoons that lie along the coastline, especially Laguna de las Garzas, (also know as Laguna de San Pedrito), and Laguna de CuyutlÃ¡nÂ âÂ both near the downtown and hotel zones. Both are notable for the variety of species and the abundance of herons and white pelicans. Puerto Vallarta offers several options in surrounding areas, so birdwatchers can opt for mountain or coastal experiences. Nearby is one of the top birdwatching lagoons in America, the Laguna del Quelele. The offshore Marietas Islands offer the rare opportunity to sight Blue- (and Yellow-) Footed Booby Birds. Open Air Expeditions (Tel. (3) [222-3310]), offers some of the better-organized tours led by expert guides.

Located 150 miles north of Vallarta is the small coastal town of San Blas, once an important port, but now primarily noted for its abundant birds. The best sightings are along the Tovara River, up to the La Tovava natural springs. Jungle cruises in small boats can be arranged through the Hotel Garza Canela in San Blas (Tel. (3) [285-0307]), or through any Puerto Vallarta travel agency. In Zihuatanejo, local travel agencies can arrange for day trips to Los Morros de los Pericos island, where a great variety of birds nest.

Whale-watching is an awe-inspiring experience, and the Mexican Pacific is one of the few places in the world that offers an opportunity to view these majestic mammals in their natural habitat. From late November through March, the waters of Banderas Bay become the breeding and calving grounds for hundreds of migrating humpback whales, much to the delight of the hundreds of visitors that enjoy witnessing the breaching, spy-hopping, leaps, and other displays of whale behavior. Eco-conscious tour operators throughout the bay (most are based in Puerto Vallarta) have voluntarily established norms for whale-watching, which allow up-close observation while disturbing them as minimally as possible. Authorized and knowledgeable tour operators include Vallarta Adventure (Tel. (3) 221-0657), and Open Air Expeditions (Tel. (3) [222-3310]). Whales have even been known to swim right alongside Puerto Vallartaâs main boardwalk, the malecÃ³n, giving its visitors a special treat.

Another seasonal, and very worthwhile eco-conscious activity, is to participate in the nightly sea turtle releases and watches that take place from August through November along the shores of Banderas Bay, and further south in Mazunte (located between Huatulco and Puerto Escondido). Preservation groups and trained specialists conduct these releases and watches. You participate by helping to collect the turtlesâ eggs and taking them to a safe nesting area for incubation. After the baby turtles hatch, they are released back into the ocean. Organized visits to the turtle camps are conducted daily in Mazunte, at the Centro Mexicano de la Tortuga, and in Puerto Vallarta by several of the beachfront hotels and a select group of ecologically oriented tour operators, such as Eco-tours de MÃ©xico (Tel. (3) [222-6606]).

ATV Jungle Tours are a fun, albeit rowdier way to see the off-the-beaten-path areas surrounding Puerto Vallarta and Huatulco. For details in Huatulco contact Cantera Tours (Tel. (9) 581-0030); in Puerto Vallarta call Pathfinders at Chicoâs Dive Shop (Tel. (3) [222-1875]). If you like the adventure of traveling through the jungle, Vallarta Adventure in Puerto Vallarta, offers an extraordinary tour of the Sierra Madre Mountains on board Mercedes Benz all-terrain vehicles (called Unimogs). The tour includes a visit to a secluded beach and a detailed explanation of the flora and fauna of the area.

Lovers of speed and thrill-seekers will enjoy the fast-paced tour along the Papagayo River, 72 km (48 miles) north of Acapulco. Shotover-Jet (Tel. (7) [484-1154]), travels aboard specially-designed 12-passenger turbo boats, which come screaming up to the face of the canyon, and then make a fast spin before continuing up the river, while making repeated 360Â° turns. To say that itâs a rush is an understatement, and their eco-conscious pamphlet is good for a chuckle, considering the reality of the experience. They are, however, making new rafting excursions available for those who prefer to experience the Papagayo River a little closer to its natural state.

Contemporary art. Puerto Vallarta offers a unique opportunity to view an excellent cross-section of Latin American art. Works by recognized mastersÂ âÂ including contemporaries JosÃ© Luis Cuevas and Alejandro ColungaÂ âÂ as well as emerging artists, are on display at the numerous art galleries in town. Notable among the galleries are GalerÃ­a PacÃ­fico (Tel. (3) 222-1982) and GalerÃ­a Rosas Blanca (Tel. (3) 222-1168), located downtown; and GalerÃ­a Flores and Arte de las Americas (Tel. (3) [221-1985]), in Marina Vallarta. It is important to note that original art is duty free in the US and many European countries, and that most galleries are experts in packing, shipping, and handling.

The hutongs can be toured on your ownÂ âÂ on foot, by rented bicycle, or by hiring one of the canopied pedicabs in the area. But most visitors prefer a guided tour. The Beijing Hutong Tourist Agency (Tel. 6[615-9097]), which books tours through hotel desks, has a fleet of red-canopied pedicabs led by an English-speaking guide. Its hutong tour combines many of the sights in the Back Lakes District with the opportunity to step inside a courtyard house and talk with its modern-day residents.

None of these reforms pleased the Russians and Prussians, who continued to covet Polish territory. Russia invaded Poland and in 1[792-1793] it, along with Prussia, imposed a second partition of Poland, annulling the constitution and essentially divying up the country between them. Tadeusz KoÂ§ciuszko, a hero of the American War of Independence, led a military insurrection in 1794, defeating the Russians with a mostly peasant army. The uprising was quashed, however, and in 1795, Poniatowski was forced to abdicate. A third partition crushed Poland and placed the country under the control of Austria, Prussia, and Russia. Poland ceased to existÂ âÂ its very name was abolished by treatyÂ âÂ for the next 123 years. Warsaw went to Prussia, KrakÃ³w to Austria.

In the 19th century so many leading intellectuals lived here that the city became known as âThe Athens of the United States.â On Chestnut Street alone, there lived historian Francis Parkman, actor Edwin Booth, author Julia Ward Howe, and painter John Singer Sargent. Louisa May Alcott and Nathaniel Hawthorne resided on Pinckney Street, while Beacon Street which Oliver Wendell Holmes dubbed âthe sunny street that holds the sifted fewâ boasted historian William Prescott. At number 10 Beacon, stop at the Boston Athenaeum (Tel. [227-0270]; guided tours Tuesday and Thursday at 3pm; reservations needed), a haven for writers and intellectuals since it was established in 1807. The 750,000-volume collection is amazing, but so too is the interior of the 1849 building, which is exquisitely furnished with antiques, busts of Benjamin Franklin, Daniel Webster, and others, and several paintings by John Singer Sargent and Gilbert Stuart. Farther along Beacon at number 45, Harrison Gray Otis died in the house that Bulfinch designed for him. Donât miss the London-style Louisburg Square surrounded by some of the finest Greek Revival homes in New England.

Nichols House (55 Mount Vernon Street; Tel. [227-6993], open for guided tours MayâOctober TuesdayâSaturday, noonâ5pm; FebruaryâApril and NovemberâDecember Monday, Wednesday, and Friday noonâ5pm), offers a chance to view the interior of a residence attributed to Bulfinch. The rooms are exactly as they were when the owner, Rose Standish Nichols, a noted landscape architect died in 1960. Furnishings include Flemish tapestries, Oriental rugs, and European and Asian art. Donât overlook Acorn StreetÂ âÂ the prettiest of them allÂ âÂ a cobbled lane so narrow that cars canât park here to spoil a photographerâs picture. Charles Street serves as the communityâs main street and as a magnet for serious antique collectors. Also note the Charles Street Meeting House, where Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, and other abolitionists preached.

Boat builder Nathaniel Hichborn, Revereâs cousin, lived in what is now the Pierce-Hichborn House, one of the cityâs earliest brick Georgians built in 1711. On most days, there are two guided tours (details available from the Paul Revere House; Tel. [523-2338] for more information).

Head west down Commercial and Causeway streets, and you will soon reach North Station and the site of the old Boston Garden, the beloved arena for the Bruins ice hockey and the Celtics basketball teams until 1995. FleetCenter (Tel. [624-1000] for information on events) has now replaced it.

Thereâs not that much to do or see on the seven islands that make up Boston Harbor Islands State Park, but an afternoon spent here offers gentle strolls, picnics, and bird-watchingÂ âÂ a welcome respite from urban frenzy. From May to mid-October, the Boston Harbor Cruise Company (Tel. [723-7800]) operates a ferry from Long Wharf to Georges Island, the core of the group. Fort Warren, a 19th-century star-shaped fortress in which Confederate prisoners were incarcerated during the Civil War occupies most of the island. Itâs an atmospheric and spooky place, with old gun emplacements, lookout posts, and chilly alleys.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), founded in 1861 is Americaâs leading science and engineering establishment that has pioneered many modern technologies, from stroboscopic photography to food preservation processes. Its graduates have started 4,000 companies and the list of its Nobel Prize Winners is long. The modern campus which has 28,000 students feels and looks very different from Harvard. Secure a map at the Information Center (located in the Rogers Building, 77 Massachusetts Avenue) and take a self-guided tour or join one of the student-led tours that are given weekdays. The MIT Museum (265 Massachusetts Avenue; Tel. [253-4440]; open TuesdayâFriday 10amâ5pm, SatâSun noonâ5pm) explores the relationship between art, science, and technology. The List Visual Arts Center puts on challenging contemporary art exhibitions. To the west of the Rogers Building, see Eero Saarinenâs striking, glass-sided Kresge Auditorium and circular, moated brick chapel. Other notable buildings include: Alvar Aaltoâs Baker House, I. M Peiâs Weisner Building, Green, Dreyfus and Landau Buildings, and Eduardo Catalanoâs Stratton Student Center. MIT also has a superb sculpture collection containing works by Alexander Calder, Louise Nevelson, and Frank Stella. See the Henry Moore piece in Killian Court, east of the Rogers Building and Calderâs The Big Sail outside the Dreyfus Building.

The best way to reach both towns and to tour the sites is by car (half an hour or 14 miles/22 km west of Boston on Route 2 and Route 4/225). You can see the main historical sights in a day, but youâll need a second visit to appreciate Concordâs rich literary heritage. During the summer and every year on Patriotâs Day (see page 91), battles are staged, and the militiamen demonstrate their drill. Call (978) [369-3120] for further details.

In summer, it is incredibly crowded, and so if you can, you should avoid the Friday evening mass exodus, (see page 105) and visit during the week or off-season when itâs only an hour from Boston to Sandwich, the nearest town on the Cape. With so many alluring inns, however, why not plan to stay overnight, but make sure to reserve in advance. Provincetown is right at the end of the Cape and in summer can most easily be reached from Boston via the ferry operated by Bay State Cruise Company (Tel. [748-1428]).

Teatro Tapia (Tel. 721-0169) in Old San Juan and the Centro de Bellas Artes (Tel. 725-7337) in the suburb of Santurce hold regular performances that range from traditional ballet to classical theater to modern works by todayâs most prodigious talents. Teatro La Perla (Tel. [843-4080]) in Ponce also has a full card of performances, especially at festival time.

The LeLoLai VIP initiative is a package of benefits that offers discounts at many attractions, and participating hotels, restaurants, and shops. The package costs just $10, but the savings can be more than $2,500 if you endeavor to use all the coupons. The package must be purchased after your arrival in Puerto Rico. Contact the Casita Tourist Office on your arrival, or call [723-3135] or 800-STAR (in the US) for more details.

Although itâs not Las Vegas, you will find casinos at all the major resort areas around the island. The majority are concentrated on the Condado/Isla Verde strip. The Condado Plaza on Ashord Avenue (Tel. 721-1000) and the El San Juan Hotel in Isla Verde (Tel. [791-0390]) are two.

The Puerto del Rey Marina near Fajardo has one of the largest charter-boat bases in the CaribbeanÂ âÂ here you can arrange for a bare-boat charter, or a day-sail or power-boat rental. (They also service the San Juan area.) The Caribbean School of Aquatics in San Juan (Tel. [728-6606]) has a 50-ft (15-m) catamaran for day sails. In La Parguera you can rent small power boats to explore the mangrove swamps, including Lovers Hole and the phosphorescent bay.

Puerto Ricoâs natural and unspoiled interior offers lots of opportunity to get away from the city and commune with nature. With such a wealth of different environments to enjoy, itâs well worth making the effort to leave your hotel. El Yunque (the Caribbean National Forest), southeast of San Juan, is crisscrossed by numerous trails. The hike from the visitors center to La Mina Falls and back takes about an hour, but there are longer trails if you want to spend a whole day out. Stop by the El Portal Tropical Forest Center before setting out; guides are available, but you must request one in advance (Tel. [888-1880]).

Museo del NiÃ±o (Plazuela de las Monjas, opposite San Juan Cathedral; Tel. [722-3791]). An engaging hands-on museum designed just for children. Open TueâThur 9amâ 3:30pm, Fri 9amâ5pm, Sat and Sun 12:30â5pm.

Theater: Ancient Greeks were credited with inventing drama and comedy in the theater, and this tradition carries on into the present. The city boasts around 50 theaters and the season is a popular one lasting from October to May. Most of the performances are in Greek. The Athens Festival runs from May to September with a full program of cultural events ranging from choral concerts to dance to recitals with performances aimed at visitors as well as Athenians. For details of the program contact the Greek National Tourist Board at Odos Voukourestiou 1, Tel. 01-[9694500].

The following theaters stage performances for tourists, or performances that would appeal to international audiences. The National Theater and Concert Hall, Tel. 01-[7282333], more commonly known as the Megaron, is situated on Vas. Sofias, next to the Megaro Mousikis Metro station. It has a program of new and established works in addition to choral, opera, and other musical performances by Greek and international musicians and dance groups.

The Roman Odeon of Herodes Atticus near the Acropolis holds classical performances on summer evenings. The seating has been renovated so there is no fear of sitting on worn stone, but this is perhaps your greatest opportunity to view a performance as the ancients did. Tel. 01-[3232771] for details.

Lycabettus Theater on Mount Lycabettus also holds regular summer performances but is less likely to be internationally oriented. For program details, Tel. 01-[7227233].

Sound and Light Show: The history of the Acropolis is brought to life through dancing lights and an informative narration, and the surrounding darkness really allows you to study the beauty of the Parthenon. This is a must for all visitors. Performances take place nightly May to October in English at 9pm. Tel. 01-[3225904] for details.

Traditional Music and Dance: Greece has a rich legacy of folk dance and music, though genuine performances are becoming more difficult to find, particularly in the capital. Dora Stratou Folk Dance Theater presents performances of traditional Greek song, dance, and music at a traditional âfolk-villageâ-type auditorium on Philopappos Hill from May to SeptemberÂ âÂ daily except Mondays. Tel. 01-[3244395] for ticketing details and prices.

The proximity of Athens to the coast offers a great opportunity to combine beach activities with a city vacation. Traveling by taxi from a downtown hotel, it only takes 30 minutes to find some excellent facilities. Much of Athens closes down during the heat of August (though not those relating to tourism) and many people head to the coast for the cooler air, therefore you find the resorts very busy at this time. The season is short, with many hotels opening in May and closing again in September. The closest resort to the city is GlyfÃ¡da, only 12 km (7 miles) from the city. Its proximity to Athens makes it extremely busy, especially on weekends and it lies very close to the approach to the old airport, which in the past resulted in a lot of aircraft noise. Twenty kilometers (12 miles) away is VoÃºla, a little less crowded than GlyfÃ¡da. VouliagmÃ©ni is 5 km (3 miles) further south, and a haunt for the local Athens jet-set because of the spa situated at the sulphur lake that gives the resort its name. For more details about spa treatments, Tel. 01-[8960341]. There are a number of luxury hotels situated here. Each of these resorts has a Greek Tourist Boardâapproved beach with changing facilities, food, and watersports. There is a small entrance fee.

For those whose city hotel doesnât have a pool the following two hotels allow non-guests to enjoy the facilities for an admission feeÂ âÂ the Athens Hilton 46, Vas, Sofias Ave, Tel. 01-7720201; and the Caravel Hotel, Vas, Alexandras Ave, Tel. 01-[7290731].

Sailing: Weekend and summer sailing is very popular with Athenians as the crowded marinas such as those at Pireaus testify. Tournaments occur regularly throughout the summer, and even the children have their own league competitions. Several companies have boats to rentÂ âÂ with crew or âbareâ if you have a skipperâs certificate. Contact the Hellenic Sailing Federation, Odos Xenofondos 15, Tel. 01-[3235560] for more details.

Fishing: You donât need to be a professional angler to enjoy a relaxing dayâs fishing. Just about every male over the age of five can be found sitting on the sea wall waiting for a bite and it is amazingly relaxing to be letting the rod do all the work. Or you can rent a small boat and head out into deeper water. Contact the Amateur Anglers and Maritime Sports Club at Moutsopoulou Quay, Tel. 01-[4515731] for more details.

Golf: There is an 18-hole golf course at GlyfÃ¡da, Tel. 01-[9846820].

Snow Skiing: The nearest facilities can be found at Mount Parnassus (from DecemberâMarch), a two-hour drive from the city. The hotels of Delphi and Arachova lie only twenty minutes from the slopes if you want a village atmosphere. Contact the Greek Alpine Club at Arachova, Tel. 01-[2324555] for more details.

As in any major city, Athens has sporting facilities in the form of private clubs and community centers. The Olympic Athletic Center of Athens at Odos Kifisias 37, Marousi (Tel. 01-[6834060]) has a range of excellent facilities including nine swimming pools, basketball courts, and a velodromeÂ âÂ all for use during the 2004 Olympic Games.

You can book tickets for performances on your arrival but popular acts or plays may sell out quickly. The VVV issues a Whatâs on in Amsterdam magazine on a monthly basis which lists the performances taking place each day. The easiest way to book tickets for performances before you arrive in town is through the Amsterdam Uit Bureau (AUB-Uitlijn). They produce a publication called Culture in Amsterdam with a listing of major performances. Contact them at Tel. [621 1211] and have your credit cards ready. Tickets can be posted to your home address or will be kept at the AUB office in Leidseplein for you to collect.

The Holland Festival is a program of art events which take place all over the country throughout June. In Amsterdam the parks and pleins are filled with organized activities, and many galleries and concert halls hold coordinated events. A special ticket line will provide information about the festival activities, and tickets if you pay by credit card (Tel. [627 6566]).

The Amsterdam Casino at Max Euweplein off Leidseplein offers the opportunity for adults to gamble (Tel. [620 1006]). Open every day from 1:30pm.

There are many wooded and park areas around the city where itâs possible to take a simple stroll or enjoy other outdoor activities. Amsterdam Bos (city woodland and recreational area), is the largest and most varied and offers a lake for rowing, bridleways for horse rides, and tracks for cyclingÂ âÂ you could hire a bike and spend the day here. Many Amsterdammers go running, frisbeeing, or simply take the dog for a walk. The stables at Amsterdam Bos offer woodland rides, a perfect way to clear the city air from your system (contact Manege de Amsterdamse; Tel. [643 1432]).

With so much water around the city, itâs not surprising that water-based sports are very popular. Even on the canals in the city center youâll find pedalos (sometimes called water cycles) to rent so that you can see the sights on your own steam. Contact them on Tel. 626 5574; fax 624 1033. You can also captain your own boat to explore the area. Canal Motorboats BV has two locations in the city; Tel. [422 7070] for information and reservations.

On the wider waterways outside the old part of town you will find rowing clubs and sailing clubs which take to the open water in good weather all year round. Out on the IJsselmeer (the inland waterway what was the Zuider Zee) on any sunny weekend youâll see hundreds of white sails breaking the horizon. Boats can be hired for trips out on the water from Monnikendam or you can take a trip on a crewed boat, although youâll need to make a booking well in advance. Contact Monnickendam Zeilcharters at ât Prooyen 4a, 1141 VD Monnickendam; Tel. 0299 652351; fax 0[299 6536]18; e-mail <hzc@sailing.nl>.

Despite spending more time than most people riding bicycles, cycling for fun is one of the major recreational activities of the Dutch. Cycle routes parallel most roadways making longer journeys relatively easy, and sporting groups or families will head out to villages like Monnikendam or Marken. Closer to the city, a ride through Vondelpark gives you a feeling of being out of the city. If you would like to tour with a group either in the city or surrounding countryside, you should contact Yellow Bike Guided Tours, Nieuwezijds Kolk 29; Tel. 620 6940, fax [620 7140]. They operate daily tours with English guides between April and October.

Classical. The Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra gives excellent concerts at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in the Music Center, and performs open-air âSymphonies under the Starsâ at the Hollywood Bowl in the summer. There are also regular recitals and concerts at Royce Hall on the UCLA campus. The San Francisco Symphony performs at Davies Hall from September through July. For less formal concerts, look into Old First Presbyterian Church on Sacramento Street at Van Ness Avenue (Tel. 415/[474-1608]). Tickets are modestly priced and the cable car will take you to within two blocks of the church.

Jazz. Try to take in some of this quintessential American musical style. San Francisco has many bars, restaurants, and clubs offering live jazz in the evening, and occasionally at Sunday lunchtime, tooÂ âÂ âjazz brunchâ is becoming something of a Sunday institution on the West Coast. Try Jazz at Pearlâs in North Beach (Tel. 415/291-8255) or Yoshiâs in Oakland (Tel. 510/[238-9200]). The San Francisco Bay Guardian is an excellent source for listings.

Among dozens of local live theater groups in San Francisco, the American Conservatory Theater (415 Geary Street; Tel. 415/749-2228) has acquired the widest national reputation. Its repertory season runs from September through June. Broadway hits appear next door at the Curran Theater or a few blocks away at the Golden Gate Theater and Orpheum. All three venues share the same telephone number (Tel. 415/[551-2000]). In summer thereâs free Shakespeare in Golden Gate Park.

For a personal touch, there are a number of guides who provide guided walks full of interesting details of local history. Contact Bermuda Lectures and Tours (Tel. 234-4082; fax [238-2773]) for further details or to arrange a custom itinerary.

With many shallow lagoons, Bermuda is a great place for windsurfing, jet skiing, pedalos, or aqua-cycling. Most large hotels will have some equipment for hire. If they donât have what you need, contact Blue Waters Divers and Watersports, which has comprehensive facilities at three sites: Somerset Bridge, Elbow Beach, and the Marriott Castle Harbour Resort. You can reach them at P.O. Box SN 165, Southampton, SN BX, Bermuda; Tel. 234-1034; fax. [234-3561]; website <www.divebermuda.com>. 

The shallow bays and rocky inlets around the coast are ideal snorkeling territory. Visibility can reach about 60 m (nearly 200 ft) since there is very little water pollution here and the reefs offer protection against the rolling waves of the outer ocean. Most hotels will have snorkeling equipment that you can rent to explore close to shore. If you want to snorkel out in the large shallow reefs on the northern side of the island, there are a number of companies offering morning or full-day trips with equipment included. One is Barefoot Cruises (Tel. 236-3498); another is Jesse James Cruises (Tel. [296-5801]).

There are a number of dive centers that provide transport to the sites and experienced and qualified dive masters to assist. Fantasea Bermuda offers diving instruction and accompanied dives as well as introductory sessions (Darrelâs Wharf, 1 Harbour Road, Paget PG 01, Bermuda; Tel. 236-0102, 888-DO-A-DIVE toll-free in US; fax 236-8926; website <www.fantasea.bm>). In addition, Nautilus Diving offers instruction and introductory sessions (Tel. 295-9485; fax [234-5180]; website <www.bermuda.bm/nautilus>). Remember to bring your dive certificate, as you will be allowed to rent equipment and dive only if you can prove your competence.

If you wish to learn to dive in Bermuda, there are a number of dive centers that offer training to professional levels. All are affiliated with one of the major certifying bodies, with PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors) being the most common. The basic qualificationÂ âÂ the Open Water CertificateÂ âÂ takes five days to complete. This will allow you to dive with an instructor to a depth of 18 m (60âft), which opens many dive sites in Bermuda to you. Blue Water Divers and Watersports offers a certification program. They have three locations around the island (write to P.O. Box SN 165, Southampton, SN BX, Bermuda; Tel. 234-1034; fax [234-3561]; website <www.divebermuda.com>).

For those who would like to experience the underwater environment at first hand but donât want to dive or canât swim, there are two companies that operate a âhelmet divingâ system. Walk on the sandy sea bottom only 21â2 m (8 ft) under the surface wearing a helmet that supplies a constant supply of oxygen. Here you can explore shallow reefs and watch the marine life swim right by. All tours are supervised by guides. Greg Hartleyâs Under Sea Adventures operates from Watford Bridge Ferry Dock in Somerset daily at 10am and 1:30pm (Tel. 234-2861). Bermuda Bell Diving is located in Flatts Village (Tel. 292-4434; fax [295-7235]). 

Sport fishing boats can be rented at most major marinas. Prices vary, but a full dayâs rental of boat and crew would be between $400 and $500. Half-day rentals are also available. Russell Young Charter Fishing offers private or split trips sailing from Somerset (Tel. 234-1832; fax 234-2930; website <www.Bermuda.bm/sportfishing>). Eureka Fishing Ltd. operates a large-capacity party fishing boat, with per-person rates (Tel. 296-5414; fax [295-3620]).

If you donât sail yourself, this is a great way to see Bermuda from the water, including the many small islands lying just off Hamilton Harbour and St. Georgeâs Harbour. Haywardâs Cruises departs from Hamilton Harbour (Tel. [292-8652]).

In the winter season (November through March), nightlife can be much quieter. But the annual Bermuda Arts Festival takes up the slack starting in January with a series of concerts, opera, plays, art exhibits, and other cultural events featuring performers and artists from around the world. The Festival is extremely popular with native Bermudians, which means many performances sell out immediately. The Tourist Office has information, or you can contact Bermuda Festival Ltd. (Tel. 295-1291; fax [295-7403]; website <www.bermudafestival.com>).

Horseback riding. There are numerous good stables and horse-riding schools just outside Budapest, and riding holidays around the Balaton area and farther aï¬eld are on offer at Budapesti Equestrian Club (tel. [313-5210]) and PetorehÃ¡zy Club Hotel (tel. 176-5937). Ask Tourinform for details, pay a visit to the aptly-named Pegazus Tours on Fereciek tere, or see the IBUSZ brochure, Riding in Hungary.

From the right-hand side of the road, well-marked trails lead through the vegetation and out toward the coast, just a few hundred meters away (a line of casuarina trees marks the spot). Wooden walkways lead you farther out over a tidal mangrove swamp to Gold Rock Beach. One of the most beautiful beaches on the island, Gold Rock must really be seen at low tide to appreciate its full glory. At high tide a shallow layer of water, only a couple of inches deep, covers much of the beach, leaving only a narrow arc of sand above the waterline. This whole area can also be explored by bicycle or kayak or by taking an eco-tour. One of the companies that offers both eco- and cultural tours of the area is East End Adventures (Tel. [373-6662]; e-mail <safari@batalnet.bs>).

New Plymouth is the largest town on the cay. It really has only one main route, Parliament Street, which is full of trim and brightly painted wooden homes with picket fences. As you walk down the street youâll hear the sounds of daily activity floating through the open windows, occasionally a radio station with news, or maybe evangelical songs. You can browse in the general stores and souvenir shops or visit one of the small art galleries that sell original works and prints by local artists. On the left as you walk away from the harbor youâll find the Memorial Sculpture Garden, dedicated to the brave settlers who founded New Plymouth. A little farther along, on the right, the Albert Lowe Museum, in an 18th-century house, is brim full of artifacts and knickknacks, maps, and newspaper articles that tell the story of New Plymouth. Lowe was a sailor and prominent shipbuilder. The house is now owned by Roland Alton Lowe, a descendant of Albert and an acclaimed Bahamian painter; his paintings and prints are sold at the museum. Abaco Gold necklaces, bracelets, and ringsÂ âÂ including some with turtle and conch shell motifsÂ âÂ are sold at the Sand Dollar Shoppe on Parliament Street (Tel. [365-4221]).

Off the coast to the south of St. Davidâs Island is smaller Nonsuch Island, once a quarantine station for sufferers of yellow fever. In 1961, a small colony of Bermuda petrels was discovered to be nesting on Nonsuch, and it has remained a sanctuary for the birds since that time. Visits are limited but can be made by arrangement with the Department of Agriculture and Parks (Tel. [236-4201]).
